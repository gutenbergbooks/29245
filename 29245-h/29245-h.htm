<h3>A TRIBUTE</h3>
<p>It is an accepted truth, I believe, that every novelist
embodies in the personalities of his heroes some of
his own traits of character. Those who were intimately
acquainted with William Otis Lillibridge could not fail to
recognize this in a marked degree. To a casual reader,
the heroes of his five novels might perhaps suggest five
totally different personalities, but one who knows them
well will inevitably recognize beneath the various disguises
the same dominant characteristics in them all.
Whether it be Ben Blair the sturdy plainsman, Bob McLeod
the cripple, Dr. Watson, Darley Roberts, or even
How Landor the Indian, one finds the same foundation
stones of character,&ndash;&ndash;repression, virility, firmness of purpose,
an abhorrence of artificiality or affectation,&ndash;&ndash;love
of Nature and of Nature&#8217;s works rather than things man-made.
And these were unquestionably the pronounced
traits of Will Lillibridge&#8217;s personality. Markedly reserved,
silent, forceful, he was seldom found in the places
where men congregate, but loved rather the company of
books and of the great out-doors. Living practically his
entire life on the prairies it is undoubtedly true that he
was greatly influenced by his environment. And certain
it is that he could never have so successfully painted the
various phases of prairie-life without a sympathetic, personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>The story of his life is characteristically told in this
brief autobiographical sketch, written at the request of an
interested magazine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was born on a farm in Union County, Iowa, near
the boundary of the then Dakota Territory. Like most
boys bred and raised in an atmosphere of eighteen hours
of work out of twenty-four, I matured early. At twelve
I was a useful citizen, at fifteen I was to all practical
purposes a man,&ndash;&ndash;did a man&#8217;s work whatever the need.
In this capacity I was alternately farmer, rancher, cattleman.
Something prompted me to explore a university
and I went to Iowa, where for six years I vibrated between
the collegiate, dental, and medical departments. After
graduating from the dental in 1898 I drifted to Sioux
Falls and began to practise my profession. As the years
passed the roots sank deeper and I am still here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Work? My writing is done entirely at night. The
waiting-room,&ndash;&ndash;the plum-tree,&ndash;&ndash;requires vigorous shaking
in the daytime. After dinner,&ndash;&ndash;I have a den, telephone-proof,
piano-proof, friend-proof. What transpires
therein no one knows because no one has ever seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recreation? I have a mania, by no means always
gratified,&ndash;&ndash;to be out of doors. Once each summer &#8216;the
Lady&#8217; and I go somewhere for a time,&ndash;&ndash;and forget it
absolutely. In this way we&#8217;ve been able to travel a bit.
We,&ndash;&ndash;again &#8216;the Lady&#8217; and I,&ndash;&ndash;steal an hour when
we can, and drive a gasoline car, keeping within the speed
laws when necessary. Once each Fall, when the first
frost shrivels the corn-stalk and when, if you chance to be
out of doors after dark you hear, away up overhead, invisible,
the accelerating, throbbing, diminishing purr of
wings that drives the sportsman mad,&ndash;&ndash;the town knows
me no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every novel may have a happy close, but a real life&#8217;s
story has but one inevitable ending,&ndash;&ndash;Death.</p>
<p>And to &#8220;the Lady&#8221; has been left the sorrowful task
of writing &#8220;Finis&#8221; across the final page.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vii' name='page_vii'></a>vii</span></p>
<p>January 29, 1909, he died at his home in Sioux Falls
after a brief illness. But thirty-one years of age, he had
won a place in literature so gratifying that one might
well rest content with a recital of his accomplishments.
But his youth suggests a tale that is only partly told and
the conjecture naturally arises,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;What success might
he not have won?&#8221; Five novels, &#8220;Ben Blair,&#8221; &#8220;Where
the Trail Divides,&#8221; &#8220;The Dissolving Circle,&#8221; &#8220;The
Quest Eternal,&#8221; and &#8220;The Dominant Dollar,&#8221; besides
magazine articles, and a number of short stories
(many of them appearing in this volume) were all written
in the space of eight years&#8217; time, and, as he said, were
entirely produced after nightfall.</p>
<p>While interested naturally in the many phases of his
life,&ndash;&ndash;as a professional man, as an author, as the chief
factor in the domestic drama,&ndash;&ndash;yet most of all it pleases
me to remember him as he appeared when under the spell
of the prairies he loved so well. Tramping the fields in
search of prairie-chicken or quail, a patient watcher in the
rushes of a duck-pond, or merely lying flat on his back in
the sunshine,&ndash;&ndash;he was a being transformed. For he
had in him much of the primitive man and his whole
nature responded to the &#8220;call of the wild.&#8221; But you
who know his prairie-tales must have read between the
lines,&ndash;&ndash;for who, unless he loved the &#8220;honk&#8221; of the
wild geese, could write, &#8220;to those who have heard it year
by year it is the sweetest, most insistent of music. It is
the spirit of the wild, of magnificent distances, of freedom
impersonate&#8221;?</p>
<p>To the late Mrs. Wilbur Teeters I am indebted for the
following tribute, which appeared in the &#8220;Iowa Alumnus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Lillibridge&#8217;s field of romance was his own.
Others have told of the Western mountains and pictured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
the great desert of the Southwest, but none has painted
with so masterful a hand the great prairies of the Northwest,
shown the lavish hand with which Nature pours
out her gifts upon the pioneer, and again the calm cruelty
with which she effaces him. In the midst of these scenes
his actors played their parts and there he played his own
part, clean in life and thought, a man to the last, slipping
away upon the wings of the great storm which had just
swept over his much-loved land, wrapped in the snowy
mantle of his own prairies.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A BREATH OF PRAIRIE</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Dense darkness of early morning
wrapped all things within and without
a square, story-and-a-half prairie farm-house.
Silence, all-pervading, dense as the darkness,
its companion, needed but a human ear to become
painfully noticeable.</p>
<p>Up-stairs in the half-story attic was Life.
From one corner of the room deep, regular
breathing marked the unvarying time of healthy
physical life asleep. Nearby a clock beat loud
automatic time, with a brassy resonance&ndash;&ndash;healthy
mechanical life awake. Man and machine,
side by side, punctuated the passage of
time.</p>
<p>Alone in the darkness the mechanical mind
of the clock conceived a bit of fiendish pleasantry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
With violent, shocking clamor, its
deafening alarm suddenly shattered the stillness.</p>
<p>The two victims of the outrage sat up in bed
and blinked sleepily at the dark. The younger,
in a voice of wrath, relieved his feelings with
a vigorously expressed opinion of the applied
uses of things in general, and of alarm-clocks
and milk pans in particular. He thereupon
yawned prodigiously, and promptly began
snoring away again, as though nothing had
interrupted.</p>
<p>The other man made one final effort, and
came down hard upon the middle of the floor.
Rough it was, uncarpeted, cold with the damp
chill of early morning. He groped for a match,
and dressed rapidly in the dim light, his teeth
chattering a diminishing accompaniment until
the last piece was on.</p>
<p>Deep, regular breathing still came from the
bed. The man listened a moment, irresolutely;
then with a smile on his face he drew a feather
from a pillow, and, rolling back the bed-clothes,
he applied the feather&#8217;s tip to the sleeper&#8217;s bare
soles, where experience had demonstrated it to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
be the most effective. Dodging the ensuing
kick, he remarked simply, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the light,
Jim. Better hurry&ndash;&ndash;this is going to be a
busy day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside, a reddish light in the sky marked
east, but over all else there lay only starlight,
as, lantern in hand, he swung down the frozen
path. With the opening barn door there came
a puff of warm animal breath. As the first
rays of light entered, the stock stood up with
many a sleepy groan, and bright eyes shining
in the half-light swayed back and forth in the
narrow stalls, while their owners waited patiently
for the feed they knew was coming.</p>
<p>Jim, still sleepy, appeared presently; together
the two went through the routine of
chores, as they had done hundreds of times
before. They worked mechanically, being still
stiff and sore from the previous day&#8217;s work, but
swiftly, in the way mechanical work is sometimes
done.</p>
<p>Side by side, with singing milk pails between
their knees, Jim stopped long enough to ask,
&#8220;Made up your mind yet what you&#8217;ll do,
Guy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>The older brother answered without a break
in the swish of milk through foam:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t, Jim. If it wasn&#8217;t for you
and father and mother and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he diverted with
a redoubled clatter of milk on tin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be honest, Guy,&#8221; was the reproachful
caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and Faith,&#8221; added the older brother
simply.</p>
<p>The reddish glow in the east had spread and
lit up the earth; so they put out the lantern,
and, bending under the weight of steaming milk
pails, walked single file toward the house and
breakfast. Far in the distance a thin jet of
steam spreading broadly in the frosty air
marked the location of a threshing crew. The
whistle,&ndash;&ndash;thin, brassy,&ndash;&ndash;spoke the one word
&#8220;Come!&#8221; over miles of level prairie, to the
scattered neighbors.</p>
<p>Four people, rough, homely, sat down to a
breakfast of coarse, plain cookery, and talked
of common, homely things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you didn&#8217;t get so much milk as usual
this morning, Jim,&#8221; said the mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, the line-backed heifer kicked over a
half-pailful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to finish shuckin&#8217; that west field this
week, Guy?&#8221; asked the father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;ll cross over before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said. They were all
hungry, and in the following silence the jangle
of iron on coarse queensware, and the aspiration
of beverages steaming still though undergoing
the cooling medium of saucers, filled in
all lulls that might otherwise have seemed to
require conversation.</p>
<p>Not until the boys got up to go to work did
the family bond draw tight enough to show.
Then the mother, tenderly as a surgeon, dressed
the chafed spots on her boys&#8217; hands, saying low
in words that spoke volumes, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be so glad
when the corn&#8217;s all husked&#8221;; and the father
followed them out onto the little porch to add,
&#8220;Better quit early so&#8217;s to hear the speakin&#8217; to-night,
Guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you feeling to-day, father?&#8221;
asked the young man, in a tone he attempted
to make honestly interested, but which an infinite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
number of repetitions had made almost
automatic.</p>
<p>The father hesitated, and a look of sadness
crept over his weathered face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No better, Guy.&#8221; He laid his hand on the
young man&#8217;s shoulder, looking down into the
frank blue eyes with a tenderness that made his
rough features almost beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all depends upon you now, Guy, my
boy.&#8221; Unconsciously his voice took on the incomparable
pathos of age displaced. &#8220;I&#8217;m out
of the race,&#8221; he finished simply.</p>
<p>The heavy, weather-painted lumber wagon
turned at the farm-yard, and rumbled down a
country road, bound hard as asphalt in the fall
frosts. The air cut sharply at the ears of the
man in the box, as he held the lines in either
hand alternately, swinging its mate with vigor.
The sun was just peeping from the broad lap
of the prairie, casting the beauty of color and
of sparkle over all things. Ahead of the wagon
coveys of quail broke and ran swiftly in the
track until tired, when, with a side movement
the tall grass by the border absorbed them.
Flocks of prairie-chickens, frightened by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
clatter, sprang winging from the roadside, and
together sailed away on spread wings. The
man in the wagon looked about him and forgetting
all else in the quick-flowing blood of
morning, smiled gladly.</p>
<p>He stopped at the edge of the field, tying
the reins loosely and building up the sideboards,
gradually shorter, each above the other,
pyramid-like, until they reached higher than
his own head as he stood in the wagon-box.
Stiff from the jolting and inactivity of the
drive, he jumped out upon the uneven surface
of the corn-field.</p>
<p>Slowly at first, as sore fingers rebelled against
the roughness of husks, he began work, touching
the frosty ears gingerly; then as he warmed
to the task, stopping at nothing. The frost,
dense, all-covering, shook from the stalks as
he moved, coloring the rusty blue of his
overalls white, and melting ice-cold, wet him
through to the skin on arms and shoulders and
knees. Swiftly, two motions to the ear, he kept
up a tapping like the regular blows of a hammer,
as the ears struck the sideboard. Fifteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
taps to the minute, you would have counted; a
goodly man&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>This morning, though, Landers&#8217; mind was
not upon his work. The vague, uncertain restlessness
that marked the birth of a desire for
broader things than he had known heretofore,
was taking form in his brain. He himself could
not have told what he wanted, what he planned;
he simply felt a distaste for the things of Now;
an unrest that prevented his sitting quiet; that
took him up very early at morning; that made
him husk more bushels of corn, and toss more
bundles of grain into the self-feed of a threshing
machine than any other man he knew; that
kept him awake thinking at night until the discordant
snores of the family sent him to bed,
with the covers over his ears in self-defence.</p>
<p>A vague wonder that such thoughts were in
his mind at all was upon him. He was the son
of his parents; his life so far had been their
life: why should he not be as content as they?</p>
<p>He could not answer, yet the distaste grew.
Irresistibly he had acquired a habit of seeing
unpleasant things: the meanness and the smallness
of his surroundings; the uncouth furnishings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
of his home; the lack of grace in his parents
and acquaintances; the trifling incidents that
required so many hours of discussion; and in all
things the absence of that sense of humor and
appreciation of the lighter side of life which,
from reading, he had learned to recognize.</p>
<p>Try as he might, he could not recollect even
the faint flash of a poor pun coming originally
from his parents. Was he to be as they? A
feeling of intense repugnance swept over him
at the thought&ndash;&ndash;a repugnance unaccountable,
and of which he felt much ashamed.</p>
<p>Self-suspicion followed. Was it well for
him to read the books and think the thoughts of
the past year? He could not escape except by
brutally tearing himself by the roots from his
parents&#8217; lives. It was all so hopelessly selfish
on his part!</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; answered the hot spirit of resentment,
&#8220;but is it not right that you should think
first of Self? Is not individual advancement
the first law of Nature? If there is something
better, why should you not secure it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The innate spirit of independence, the intense
passion of pride and equality inborn with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the true country-bred, surged warmly through
his body until he fairly tingled.</p>
<p>Why should others have things, think
thoughts, enjoy pleasures of which he was to
remain in ignorance? The mood of rebellion
was upon him and he swore he would be as
they. Of the best the world contained, he,
Guy Landers, would partake.</p>
<p>With the decision came an exultant consciousness
of the graceful play of his own
muscles in rapid action. The self-confidence
of the splendid animal was his. He would
work and advance himself. The world must
move, and he would help. He would do things,
great things, of which he and the world would
be proud.</p>
<p>Unconsciously he worked faster and faster
as thought travelled. The other wagons
dropped behind, the tapping of corn ears on
their sideboards making faint music in the
clear air.</p>
<p>The sun rose swiftly, warming and drying
the earth. Instead of frost the dust of weathered
husks fell thickly over him. Overflowing
with life and physical power, he worked through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the long rows to the end, then mounted the
wagon and looked around. Silently he noted
the gain over the other workers, and a smile lit
up the sturdy lines of his face.</p>
<p>Evening was approaching. The rough lumber
wagon, heavily loaded from the afternoon&#8217;s
work, groaned loudly over the uneven ground.
Instead of the east, the west was now red,
glorious. High up in the sky, surrounding the
glow, a part of it as well, narrow luminous
sun-dogs presaged uncertain weather to follow.</p>
<p>Guy Landers mounted the wagon wearily,
and looked ahead. The end of the two loaded
corn-rows which he was robbing was in sight,
and he returned doggedly to his task. The
ardor of the morning had succumbed to the
steady grind of physical toil, and he worked
with the impassive perseverance of a machine.</p>
<p>Night and the stillness thereof settled fast.
The world darkened so swiftly that the change
could almost be distinguished. The rows ahead
grew shadowy, and in their midst, by contrast,
the corn-ears stood out white and distinct. The
whole world seemed to draw more closely together.
The low vibrant hum that marked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
location of the distant threshing crew, sounded
now almost as near as the voice of a friend. A
flock of prairie-chickens flew low overhead,
their flatly spread wings cutting the air with
a sound like whips. They settled nearby, and
out of the twilight came anon the confused
murmur of their voices.</p>
<p>Landers stopped the impatient horses at the
end of the field, and shook level the irregular,
golden heap in the wagon-box. Slowly he
drew on coat and top-coat, and mounted the
full load, sitting sideways with legs hanging
over the bulging wagon-box. It was dark now,
but he was not alone. Other wagons were
groaning homeward as well. Suddenly, thin
and brassy, out of the distance came the sound
of a steam whistle; and when it was again silent
the hum of the thresher had ceased. From a
field by the roadside, a solitary prairie-rooster
gave once, twice, its lone, restless call.</p>
<p>The man stretched back full length on the
corn bed and looked up where the stars sparkled
clear and bright. It all appealed to him, and a
moisture formed in his eyes. A new side to the
problem of the morning came to him. These
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
sounds&ndash;&ndash;he realized now how he loved them.
Verily they were a part of his life. Mid them
he had been bred; of them as of food he had
grown. That whistle, thin and unmusical; that
elusive, indescribable call of prairie male; all
these homely sounds that meant so much to him&ndash;&ndash;could
he leave them?</p>
<p>The moisture in his eyes deepened and a
tightness gripped his throat. Slowly two great
tears fought their way down through the dust
on his face, and dropped lingeringly, one after
the other amid the corn-ears.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The little, low, weather-white school-house
stood glaring solitarily in the bright starlight,
from out its setting of brown, hard-trodden
prairie. Within, the assembled farmers were
packed tight and regular in the seats and aisles,
like kernels on an ear of corn. In the front
of the room a little space had been shelled bare
for the speaker, and the displaced human kernels
thereto incident were scattered crouching
in the narrow hall and anteroom. From without,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
groups of men denied admittance, thrust
hairy faces in at the open windows. A row of
dusty, grease-covered lamps flanked by composition
metal reflectors, concentrated light
upon the shelled spot, leaving the remainder
of the room in variant shadow. The low murmur
of suppressed conversation, accompanied
by the unconscious shuffling of restless feet,
sounded through the place. Becoming constantly
more noticeable, an unpleasant, penetrating
odor, of the unclean human animal
filled the room.</p>
<p>Guy Landers sat on a crowded back seat,
where, leaning one elbow on his knee, he shaded
his eyes with his hand. On his right a big,
sweaty farmer was smoking a stale pipe. The
smell of the cheap, vile tobacco, bad as it was,
became a welcome substitute for the odor of
the man himself.</p>
<p>At his left were two boys of his own age,
splendid, both of them, with the overflowing
vitality that makes all young animals splendid.
They were talking&ndash;&ndash;of women. They spoke
low, watching sheepishly whether any one was
listening, and snickering suppressedly together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s head dropped in his hands.
It all depressed him like a weight. From the
depths of his soul he despised them for their
vulgarity, and hated himself for so doing, for
he was of their life and work akin. He shut
his eyes, suffering blindly.</p>
<p>Consciousness returned at the sound of a
strangely soft voice, and he looked up a little
bewildered. A swarm of night-bugs encircled
each of the greasy lamps, blindly beating out
their lives against the hot chimney; but save
this and the soft voice there was no other sound.
The man at the right held his pipe in his hand;
to the left the boys had ceased whispering; one
and all were listening to the speaker with the
stolid, expressionless gaze of interested animals.</p>
<p>Guy Landers could not have told why he
had come that night. Perhaps it was in response
to that gregarious instinct which prompts us all
at times to mingle with a crowd; certainly he
had not expected to be interested. Thus it was
with almost a feeling of rebellious curiosity that
he caught himself listening intently.</p>
<p>The speech was political, the speaker a
college man. What he said was immaterial&ndash;&ndash;not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
a listener but had heard the same arguments
a dozen times before; it was the man
himself that held them.</p>
<p>What the farmers in that dingy little room
saw was a smooth-faced young man, with blue
eyes set far apart and light hair that exposed
the temples far back; they heard a soft voice
which made them forget for a time that they
were very tired&ndash;&ndash;forget all else but that he
was speaking.</p>
<p>Landers saw further: not a single man, but
a type; the concrete illustration of a vague
ideal he had long known. He realized as the
others did not, that the speaker was merely
practising on them&ndash;&ndash;training, as the man himself
would have said. When Landers was
critically conscious, he was not deceived; yet,
with this knowledge, at times he forgot and
moved along with the speaker, unconsciously.</p>
<p>It was all deliriously intoxicating to the
farmer&ndash;&ndash;this first understanding glimpse of
things he had before merely dreamed of&ndash;&ndash;and
he waited exultantly for those brief moments
when he felt, sympathetically with the speaker,
the keen joy of mastery in perfect art; that joy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
beside which no other of earth can compare,
the compelling magnetism which carries another&#8217;s
mind irresistibly along with one&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>The speaker finished and sat down wearily,
and almost simultaneously the hairy faces left
the windows. The shuffling of feet and the
murmur of rough voices once more sounded
through the room; again the odor of vile
tobacco filled the air. Several of the older men
gathered around the speaker, in turn holding
his hand in a relentless grip while they struggled
bravely for words to express the broadest
of compliments. Young boys stood wide-eyed
under their fathers&#8217; arms and looked at the
college man steadily, like young calves.</p>
<p>The reaction was on the slender young
speaker, and though the experience was new,
he shook hands wearily. In spite of himself a
shade of disgust crept into his face. He was
not bidding for these farmers&#8217; votes, and the
big sweaty men were foully odorous. He
worked his way steadily out into the open air.</p>
<p>Landers, in response to a motive he made no
attempt to explain even to himself, walked over
and touched the chairman on the shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Evening, Ross,&#8221; he greeted perfunctorily.
&#8220;Pretty good talk, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Without waiting
for a reply he went on, &#8220;Suppose you&#8217;re
not hankering for a drive back to town to-night?
I&#8217;ll see that&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a swift nod toward
the departing group&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;he gets back home, if
you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross looked up in pleased surprise. He
was tired and sleepy and only too glad to accept
the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Guy,&#8221; he answered gratefully.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do as much for you some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landers waited silently until the last eulogist
had lingeringly departed, leaving the bewildered
speaker gazing about for the chairman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to take you to town,&#8221; said Landers,
simply, as he led the way toward his wagon.
He then added, as an afterthought: &#8220;If
you&#8217;re tired and prefer, you may stay with
me to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collegian, looking up to decline, met the
countryman&#8217;s eye, and for the first time the two
studied each other steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will stay with you, if you please,&#8221; he said
in sudden change of mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>They drove out, slowly, into the frosty night,
the sound of the other wagons rattling over
frozen roads coming pleasantly to their ears.
Overhead countless stars lit up the earth and
sky, almost as brightly as moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are husking corn these days,&#8221;
initiated the collegian, perfunctorily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the short answer.</p>
<p>They rode on again in silence, the other
wagons rumbling slowly away into the distance
until their sound came only as a low
humming from the frozen earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prices pretty good this season?&#8221; questioned
the college man, tentatively.</p>
<p>Landers flashed around on him almost
fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Heaven&#8217;s name, man,&#8221; he protested,
&#8220;give me credit for a thought outside my
work&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused, and his voice became
natural: &#8220;&ndash;&ndash;a thought such as other people
have,&#8221; he finished, sadly.</p>
<p>The two men looked steadily at each other,
a multitude of conflicting emotions on the face
of the collegian. He could not have been more
surprised had a clothing dummy raised its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
voice and spoken. Landers turned away and
looked out over the frosty prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;wearily. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not to blame for thinking&ndash;&ndash;as everybody else
thinks.&#8221; His companion started to interrupt
but Landers raised his hand in silencing motion.
&#8220;Let us be honest&ndash;&ndash;with ourselves, at least,&#8221;
he anticipated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we of the farm are dull, and crude,
and vulgar, and our thoughts are of common
things. You of the other world patronize us;
you practise on us as you did to-night, thinking
we do not know. But some of us do, and it
hurts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man impulsively held out his hand;
a swift apology came to his lips, but as he looked
into the face before him, he felt it would be
better left unsaid. Instead, he voiced the question
that came uppermost to his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you leave&ndash;&ndash;this&ndash;&ndash;and go to
school?&#8221; he asked abruptly. &#8220;You have an
equal chance with the rest. We&#8217;re each what
we make ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landers broke in on him quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all like to talk of equality, but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
reality we know there is none. You say &#8216;leave&#8217;
without the slightest knowledge of what in my
case it means.&#8221; He gave the collegian a quick
look.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking as though I&#8217;d known you all
my life.&#8221; A question was in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening,&#8221; said the man, simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it means, then. It means
that I divorce myself from everything of
Now; that I unlive my past life; that I
leave my companionship with dumb things&ndash;&ndash;horses
and cattle and birds&ndash;&ndash;and I love them,
for they are natural. This seems childish to
you; but live with them for years, more than
with human beings, and you will understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than all else it means that I must
become as a stranger to my family; and they
depend upon me. My friends of now would
not be my friends when I returned; they
would be as I am to you now&ndash;&ndash;a thing to be
patronized.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated, and then went recklessly on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you so much, I may as well tell
you everything. On the next farm to ours
there&#8217;s a little, brown-eyed girl&ndash;&ndash;Faith&#8217;s her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
name&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His new-found flow
of words failed, and he ended in unconscious
apostrophe:</p>
<p>&#8220;To think of growing out of her life, and
strange to my father and mother&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all so
selfish, so hideously selfish!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand,&#8221; said the soft voice
at his side.</p>
<p>They drove on without a word, the frost-bound
road ringing under the horses&#8217; feet, the
stars above smiling sympathetic indulgence at
this last repetition of the old, old tale of man.</p>
<p>The gentle voice of the collegian broke the
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it would be selfish to leave. Is it
not right, though, and of necessity, that we
think first of self?&#8221; He paused, then boldly
sounded the keynote of the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not selfishness the first law of nature?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>Landers opened his lips to answer, but closed
them without a word.

<h3>III</h3>
<p>Brown, magnetic Fall, with her overflow of
animal activity, shaded gradually into the white
of lethic Winter; then in slow dissolution relinquished
supremacy to the tans and mottled
greens of Springtime. Unsatisfied as man, the
mighty cycle of the seasons&#8217; evolution moved on
until the ripe yellow of harvest and of corn-field
wrote &#8220;Autumn&#8221; on the broad page of
the prairies.</p>
<p>Of an evening in early September, Guy Landers
turned out from the uncut grass of the
farm-yard into the yellow, beaten dust of the
country road. He walked slowly, for it was
his last night on the farm, and it would be long
ere he passed that way again. This was the
road that led to the district school-house, and
with him every inch had been familiar from
childhood. As a boy he had run barefoot in its
yellow dust, and paddled joyously in the soft
mud of its summer showers. The rows of tall
cottonwoods that bordered it on either side he
had helped plant, watching them grow year by
year, as he himself had grown, until now the
whispering of prairie night winds in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
loosely hung leaves spoke a language as
familiar as his native tongue.</p>
<p>He walked down the road for a half-mile,
and turned in between still other tall cottonwoods
at another weather-stained, square farm-house,
scarcely distinguishable from his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Evening, Mr. Baker.&#8221; He nodded to the
round-shouldered man who sat smoking on the
doorstep.</p>
<p>The farmer moved to one side, making generous
room beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Evening, Guy,&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Won&#8217;t y&#8217;
set down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night, Mr. Baker. I came over to
see Faith.&#8221; He hesitated, then added as an
afterthought: &#8220;I go away to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man on the steps smoked silently for a
minute, the glow from the corn-cob bowl emphasizing
the gathering twilight. Slowly he
took the pipe from his mouth, and, standing
up, seized the young man&#8217;s hand in the grip of
a vise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heerd y&#8217; were goin&#8217;, Guy.&#8221; He looked
down through the steadiest of mild blue eyes.
&#8220;Good-bye, my boy.&#8221; An uncertain catch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
came into his voice, and he shook the hand
harder than before. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all miss ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped his arm, and sat down on the
step, impassively resuming his pipe. Without
raising his eyes, he nodded toward the back
yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith&#8217;s back there with her posies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The young man hesitated, swallowing fiercely
at the lump in his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Mr. Baker,&#8221; he faltered at
length.</p>
<p>He walked slowly around the corner of the
house, stopping a moment to pat the friendly
collie that wagged his tail, welcomingly, in the
path. A large mixed orchard-garden, surrounded
by a row of sturdy soft maples,
opened up before him; and, coming up its
side path, with the most cautious of gingerly
treads, was the big hired man, bearing a huge
striped watermelon. He nodded in passing,
and grinned with a meaning hospitality on the
visitor.</p>
<p>At one corner of the garden an oblong mound
of earth, bordered with bright stones and river-clam
shells, marked the &#8220;posy&#8221; bed. Within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
its boundaries a collection of overgrown house
plants, belated pinks, and seeding sweet-peas,
fought for life with the early fall frosts.
Landers looked steadily down at the sorry
little garden. Like everything else he had seen
that night, it told its pathetic tale of things that
had been but would be no more.</p>
<p>As he looked, a multitude of homely blossoms
that he had plucked in the past flowered
anew in his memory. The mild faces of violets
and pansies, the gaudy blotches of phlox, stood
out like nature. He could almost smell the
heavy odor of mignonette. A mist gathered
over his eyes, and again, as at the good-bye of
a moment ago, the lump rose chokingly in his
throat.</p>
<p>He turned away from the tiny, damaged bed
to send a searching look around the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith!&#8221; he called gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;louder.</p>
<p>A soft little sound caught his ear from the
grass-plot at the border. He started swiftly
toward it, but stopped half-way, for the sound
was repeated, and this time came distinctly&ndash;&ndash;a
bitter, half-choked sob. With a motion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
weariness and of pain the man passed his hand
over his eyes, then walked on firmly, his footsteps
muffled in the short grass.</p>
<p>A dainty little figure in the plainest of calico,
lay curled up on the sod beneath the big maple.
Her face was buried in both arms; her whole
body trembled, as she struggled hard against
the great sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; interrupted the man softly,
&#8220;Faith&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sobs became more violent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, Guy,&#8221; pleaded a tearful, muffled
voice between the breaks. &#8220;Please go
away, please&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man knelt swiftly down on the grass;
irresistibly his arm spread over the dainty,
trembling, little woman. Then as suddenly he
drew back with a face white as moonlight, and
a sound in his throat that was almost a groan.</p>
<p>He knelt a moment so, then touched her
shoulder gently&ndash;&ndash;as he would have touched
earth&#8217;s most sacred thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he repeated uncertainly.</p>
<p>The girl buried her head more deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, I tell you,&#8221; she cried chokingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
&#8220;I won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she could say no more. There
were no words in her meagre vocabulary to
voice her bitterness of heart.</p>
<p>The man got to his feet almost roughly, face
and hands set like a lock. He stood a second
looking passionately down at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Faith,&#8221; he said, and his trembling
voice was the gentlest of caresses. He
started swiftly away down the path.</p>
<p>The girl listened a moment to the retreating
steps, then raised a tear-stained face above her
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guy!&#8221; she called chokingly, &#8220;Guy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man quickened his steps at the sound,
but did not turn.</p>
<p>The girl sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Guy! Guy!&#8221; pleadingly, desperately.
&#8220;Guy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had reached the open. With a
motion that was almost insane, he clapped his
hands over his ears, and ran blindly down the
dusty path until he was tired, then dropped
hopelessly by the roadside.</p>
<p>Overhead the big cottonwoods whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
softly in the starlight, and a solitary catbird
sang its lonely night song.</p>
<p>The man flung his arms around the big,
friendly tree, and sobbed wildly&ndash;&ndash;as the girl
had sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Faith!&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>A month had passed by, bringing to Guy
Landers a new Heaven and a new earth. Already
the prosy old university town had begun
to assume an atmosphere of home. The well-clipped
campus, with its huge oaks and its
limestone walks, had taken on the familiar
possessive plural &#8220;our campus,&#8221; and the solitary
red squirrel which sported fearlessly in its
midst had likewise become &#8220;our squirrel.&#8221; The
imposing, dignified college buildings had
ceased to elicit open-mouthed observance, and
among the student-body surnames had yielded
precedence to Christian names&ndash;&ndash;oftener,
though, to some outlandish sobriquet which
satirized an idiosyncrasy of temperament or outward
aspect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Meantime the farmer had learned many
things. Prominent among these was a conception
of the preponderant amount he had yet
to learn. Another matter of illumination involved
the relation of clothes to man. He had
been reared in the delusion that the person who
gave thought to that which he wore, must necessarily
think of nothing else. Very confusing,
therefore, was the experience of having representatives
of this same class immeasurably outdistance
him in the quiz room.</p>
<p>Again, on the athletic field he saw men of
much lighter weight excel him in a way that
made his face burn with a redness not of physical
exertion. It was a wholesome lesson that he
was learning&ndash;&ndash;that there are everywhere scores
of others, equally or better fitted by Nature for
the struggle of life than oneself, and who can
only be surpassed by the indomitable application
and determination that wins all things.</p>
<p>Landers&#8217; nature though was that of the born
combatant. The class that laughed openly at
his first tremblingly bashful, and ludicrously
inapt answer at quiz, was indelibly photographed
upon his memory.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Before this session is complete&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he challenged
softly to himself, and glared at those
members nearest him in a way that made them
suddenly forget the humor of the situation.</p>
<p>But youth is ever tractable, and even this
short time had accomplished much. Already
the warm, contagious, college comradeship possessed
him. Violent attacks of homesickness
that made gray the brightest fall days, like
the callous spots on his palms, were becoming
more rare. The old existence was already a
dream, as yet a little sad, but none the less a
thing without a substance. The new life was
a warm, magnetic reality; the future glowed
bright with limitless promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first day of the second month,&#8221; remarked
Landers, meeting a fellow-classman
on the way to college hall one morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, an auspicious time to quit&ndash;&ndash;this,&#8221;
completed the student with a suggestive shuffle
of his feet. &#8220;We&#8217;ve furnished our share of
amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landers looked up questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that from the class president?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the other, &#8220;hadn&#8217;t you
heard? No more dancing, &#8216;his nibs&#8217; says.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the entrance to the big
college building, and at that moment a great
roar of voices sounded from out the second-floor
windows. Simultaneously the two freshmen
quickened their pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fun&#8217;s on,&#8221; commented Landers&#8217; informant
excitedly, as together they broke for
the lecture-room, two stairs at the jump.</p>
<p>The large department amphitheatre opened
up like a fan&ndash;&ndash;the handle in the centre of the
building on the entrance floor, the spread edge,
nearly a complete half-circle, marked by the
boundary walls of the building, a full story
higher. The intervening space, at an inclination
of thirty odd degrees, was a field of
seats, cut into three equal parts by two aisles
that ran from the entrance, divergently upward.
The small space at the entrance&ndash;&ndash;popularly
dubbed &#8220;the pit&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;was professordom&#8217;s
own particular region. From this point, by an
unwritten law, the classes ranged themselves
according to the length of their university life;
the seniors at the extreme apex of the angle, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
other classes respectively above, leaving the
freshmen far beyond in space.</p>
<p>As guardians of the two narrow aisles, the
seniors dealt lightly with juniors and &#8220;sophs,&#8221;
but demanded insatiable toll of every freshman
before he was allowed to ascend.</p>
<p>That a first-year man must dance was irrevocable.
It had the authority of precedent in
uncounted graduate classes. To be sure, it was
neither required nor expected that all applicants
be masters of the art; but, agitate his feet in
some manner, every able-bodied male member
must, or remain forever a freshman.</p>
<p>When Landers and his companion arrived at
the top of the stairs they found the hall packed
close with fellow-classmates. The lower rows
of seats were already filled with triumphant
seniors, waiting for the throng that crowded
pit and lobby to come within their reach. With
regular tapping of feet and clapping of hands
in unison, the class as one man beat the steady
time of one who marches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance, freshies!&#8221; they repeated monotonously.
&#8220;Dance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear the pit for a rush,&#8221; yelled the president
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
of the besieging freshmen, elbowing his
way back into the mass.</p>
<p>A lull fell upon the room, as both sides gathered
themselves together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&ndash;&ndash;all at once!&#8221; yelled the president,
and pandemonium broke loose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rush &#8217;em! Shove, behind there!&#8221; shrieked
the struggling freshmen at the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance, freshies! Dance!&#8221; challenged the
seniors, as they locked arms across the narrow
aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em, fellows! Hold &#8217;em!&#8221; encouraged
the men of the upper seats, bracing
themselves against the broad backs below.</p>
<p>The classes met like water against a wall. To
go up was impossible; advantage of gravity and
of position was all with the seniors. For an
instant, at the centre, there were frantic yelling
and pulling of loose wearing apparel; then,
packed like cotton in a bale, they could only
scream for mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loosen up, back there! Back!&#8221; they
panted, squirming impotently as they gasped
for breath.</p>
<p>Slowly the reaction came amid the triumphant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
&#8220;Dance, freshies!&#8221; of the conquering
hosts.</p>
<p>The jam loosened; the seniors&#8217; opportunity
came. Like a big machine, the occupants of
the front row leaned forward, and seized upon
a circle of unsuspecting, retreating freshmen,
among the number the class president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass &#8217;em up! Pass &#8217;em up!&#8221; insisted the
men above, reaching out eager hands to aid;
and with an irresistibility that seemed miraculous,
the squirming, kicking, struggling freshmen
found themselves rolling upward&ndash;&ndash;head
foremost, feet foremost, position unclassified&ndash;&ndash;over
the heads of the upper classmen; bumping
against seats, and scattering the contents of
their pockets loosely along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with them,&#8221; repeated the denizens of
the front row as they reached forward for a
fresh supply.</p>
<p>But there was no more material available; the
besieging party had retreated. On the top row
the dishevelled president was confusedly pulling
himself together, and grinning sheepishly.
The rebellion was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance, freshies,&#8221; resumed the seniors mockingly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
and once more the regular tap of feet and
clapping of hands beat slow march-time.</p>
<p>One by one the freshmen came forward, and,
shuffling a few steps to the encouraging &#8220;well
done&#8221; of the seniors, mounted the steps between
the rows of laughing upper classmen.</p>
<p>It happened that Landers came last. He
wore heavy shoes and walked with an undeniable
clump.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Dutch, make him clog,&#8221; called a man
from an upper row.</p>
<p>The class caught the cry. &#8220;Clog! Clog!&#8221;
they commanded.</p>
<p>A big fellow next the aisle made an addition.
&#8220;Clog there, hayseed,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>Landers stopped as though the words were
a blow. That one word &#8220;hayseed&#8221; with all that
it meant to him&ndash;&ndash;to be thrown at him now,
tauntingly, before the whole class! His face
grew white beneath the remaining coat of tan,
and he stepped up to the big senior with a
swiftness of which no one would have suspected
him capable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that back!&#8221; he blazed into the man&#8217;s
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>The senior hesitated; the room grew breathlessly
quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it back, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>The big fellow tried to laugh, but his voice
only grated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damned if I will&ndash;&ndash;hayseed,&#8221; he retorted
with a meaning pause and accent.</p>
<p>Before the words were out of his mouth
Landers had the man by the collar, and they
were fighting like cats.</p>
<p>For a time things in that pit were very confused
and very noisy. Both students were big
and both were furiously angry. By rule they
would have been very evenly matched, but in a
rough-and-tumble scrimmage there was no comparison.
The classes made silent and neutral
spectators, as Landers swung the man around
in the narrow pit like a whirlwind, and finally
pushed him back into his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now will you take it back!&#8221; he roared
breathlessly, vigorously shaking his victim.</p>
<p>The hot lust of battle was upon the farmer,
and he forgot that several hundred students
were watching his every motion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take it back,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
and he lifted the man half out of the seat.</p>
<p>The senior seized both arms of the chair, and
looked up in a dazed sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louder&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; interrupted Landers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;beg your pardon,&#8221; said the reluctant,
trembling voice.</p>
<p>That instant the amphitheatre went wild.
&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; yelled a hundred voices over the
clamor of cheering hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for the freshman!&#8221; shrilled a
voice over the tumult; and the &#8220;rah, rah, rah&#8221;
that followed made the skylight rattle.</p>
<p>Landers stepped back and looked up bewildered;
then a realization of the thing came to
him and his face burned as no sun could make
it burn, and his knees grew weak. He gladly
would have given all his present earthly belongings,
and all in prospect for the immediate
future for a kindly earth to open suddenly and
swallow him. Perspiration stood out on his
face as he went slowly up the stairs, at every
step a row of friendly hands grasping him in
congratulation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Slowly the room became quiet. The whole
confusion had not taken up even the time of
grace at the beginning of the hour; and a great
burst of applause greeted the mild old dean as
he came absently in, as was his wont, at the tap
of the ten-minute bell. He looked up innocently
at the unusual greeting, and the cheer
was repeated with interest. As first in authority
he was supposed to report all such inter-class
offences; but in effect he invariably happened
to be conveniently absent at such times&ndash;&ndash;the
times of the freshman rebellion. He began
lecturing now without a word of comment, and
on the instant the peaceful scratching of fountain
pens on notebooks replaced the clamors
of war.</p>
<p>The lecture was about half over when there
was a tap on the entrance door; and the white-haired
dean, answering, stepped out into the
hall. In a second he returned carrying a thin,
yellow envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;A message for&ndash;&ndash;,&#8221; he studied the writing
with near-sighted eyes, &#8220;&ndash;&ndash;for Guy Landers,&#8221;
he announced slowly.</p>
<p>The message went up the incline, hand over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
hand toward the top row, and the boy who
waited felt the room growing gradually close
and dark. To him a telegram could mean but
one thing.</p>
<p>The class sat watching silently until they
saw him take the paper from his neighbor; then
in kindness they turned away at the look on
his face. In the pit below the mild old dean
began talking absently.</p>
<p>Landers tried to open the envelope, but his
nervous hands rebelled. He laid the broad
side firmly against his knee and tore open the
end raggedly, drawing out the inclosed sheet
with a trembling rustle that could be heard all
over the room.</p>
<p>The open page was before him; but the
letters only danced before his eyes. He spread
the paper as before, flat upon his knee, ere he
could read.</p>
<p>The one short line, the line of which every
word was as he expected, stood clear before
him. He felt now a vague sort of wonder that
the brief, picked sentences should have affected
him as they had. He had already known what
they told for so long&ndash;&ndash;ever since his name was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
spoken at the door&ndash;&ndash;ages ago. He looked
hesitatingly around the room. Several students
were scrutinizing him curiously, as though expecting
something. Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;that recalled
him. He must go&ndash;&ndash;home. He hated to interrupt
the lecture, but he must. He got up
unsteadily, and started down the stair, groping
his way uncertainly, as a man walks in the
dark.</p>
<p>The kind old dean waited in silence until
Landers had passed hesitatingly through the
door; then followed him out into the hall. A
moment, and he returned, standing abstractedly
by the lecture table. He picked up his
scattered notes absently, shaking the ends even
with a painstaking hand; then as carefully
scattered them as before. He looked up at the
silent, waiting class, and those who were near
saw the tears sparkling in the mild old eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Landers&#8217; father is dead,&#8221; came the simple,
hushed announcement.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>The bright afternoon sun of late October
shone slantingly on the train of weathered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
wagons that stretched out like an uncoiling
spring from the group collected in front of
the little farm-house. From near and afar the
neighbors had gathered; and now, falling
slowly into line, they formed a chain a full
quarter-mile in length.</p>
<p>Guy Landers was glad that at last it was
over and they were out in the sunshine once
more. He turned into the carefully reserved
place at the head of the procession with almost
a sense of relief. He was tired, fiercely tired,
of the well-meant but insistent pity which
dogged him with a tenacity that drove him
desperate. They would not even allow him to
think.</p>
<p>He rode alone on the front seat of the open
wagon. Behind him, his mother and Jim sat
stiffly, hand in hand. They gazed dully at the
black thing ahead, and sobbed softly, now
singly, now together. Both&ndash;&ndash;himself as well&ndash;&ndash;were
dressed in complete black; old musty
black, gotten out of the dark, hurriedly, and
with the close smell of the closet still upon it.
Even the horses conformed to the sober shade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
They had been supplied by a neighbor on
account of their sombre color.</p>
<p>A heavy black tassel swung back and forth
with the motion of the uneven road just ahead
of the horses&#8217; heads, and Landers sat watching
it idly. He even caught himself counting the
vibrations, as though it were a pendulum, dividing
the beats into minutes. Very slow time
it was; but somehow it did not surprise him.
It all conformed so perfectly with the brown,
quiet prairie, and the sun shining, slanting and
sleepy.</p>
<p>The swinging tassel grew indistinct, and the
<i>patter</i>, <i>patter</i>, <i>patter</i> of the teams behind came
as from a distance. He closed his eyes, and the
events of the past two days drifted through
his mind. Already they seemed indistinct, as
a dream. He wondered dully that they could
be true and yet seem so foreign to his life, now.
He even began to doubt their verity, and opened
his eyes slowly, half expecting to see the cool,
green campus, and the big college buildings.
The slanting sunlight met him full in the face,
and the black pendant swung monotonously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
from side to side, as before. He wearily closed
his eyes again.</p>
<p>Only two days since he had heard the taunting
&#8220;Dance, freshy!&#8221; of the seniors, and felt
the mighty rush of the freshman hosts; since
the &#8220;rah, rah, rah, Landers!&#8221; had shook the
old amphitheatre and the dozens of welcoming
hands had greeted him; and then&ndash;&ndash;the darkness&ndash;&ndash;the
hesitating leave-taking of the building,
and the lingering walk across the deserted
campus toward his room&ndash;&ndash;the walk he knew so
well he would take no more. A brief time of
waiting&ndash;&ndash;a blank&ndash;&ndash;and then the bitter, thumping
ride across two States toward his home,
when he could only think, and think, and try
to adjust himself&ndash;&ndash;and fail; and at last the
end. And again, at the little station, when he
felt the touch of his mother&#8217;s hand, and heard
her choking &#8220;Guy, my boy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; that spoke so
much of love and of trust; when he heard his
own voice answering cheerily, with a firmness
which surprised him even then, speaking that
which all through the long ride he had known
he must speak&ndash;&ndash;but could not: &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,
mother; don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll not leave you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
again!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;it all came back to him now, and
he lived it over again and again.</p>
<p>The big, black tassel danced tantalizingly
in front of him. Yes, he had said that he would
never leave again. He dully repeated the words
now to himself: &#8220;never again.&#8221; It was so fitting;
quite in accordance with the rest of the
black pageant. His dream of life, his new-felt
ambitions&ndash;&ndash;all were dead, dead, like his father
before him, where the black plume nodded.</p>
<p>They passed up through the little town and
the shop-keepers came out to look. Some were
in their shirt sleeves; the butcher had his white
apron tucked up around his belt. They gathered
together in twos and groups, nodding toward
the procession, their lips moving as in pantomime.
One man walked out to the crossing,
counting aloud as the teams went by. &#8220;One,
two, three, four, five, six&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he intoned. To
him it was all a thing to amuse, like a circus
parade,&ndash;&ndash;interesting in proportion to its
length.</p>
<p>Landers looked almost curiously at the stolid
shopmen. It required no flush of inspiration
to tell him that but a few years of this life were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
necessary to make him as impassive as they.
He who had sworn to make the world move
would be contentedly sitting on an empty goods
box, diligently numbering a passing procession!</p>
<p>The biting humor of the thought appealed
to him. He smiled grimly to himself.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>Once more on an early evening, a man turned
out from a weather-stained prairie farm-house,
through the frosted grass, arriving presently
at the dusty public road. As before, he walked
slowly along between the tall cottonwoods; but
not, as on a memorable former occasion, because
it would be for the last time. He was
tired, tired with that absolute abandon of youth
that sees no hope in the future, and has no
philosophy to support it. Only thirty odd days
since he went that way before! That many
years would not add more to his life in the
future.</p>
<p>Unconsciously he searched along the way for
the landmarks he had watched with so much
interest the past summer. He found the nest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
where the quail had reared their brood, empty
now, and covered thick with the scattered dust
of passing teams. Forgetful that he was weary
he climbed well up the bole of a shaggy old
friend, to peep in at the opening of a deserted
woodpecker&#8217;s home. He came to the big tree
at whose roots, on that other night he remembered
so well, he had thrown himself hopelessly.
With a stolid sort of curiosity he looked
down at the spot. Yes, there was the place. A
few fallen leaves were scattered upon the earth
where his body had pressed tightly against the
tree-trunk, and there were the hollows where
his clenched hands had found hold. A dull
rebellion crept over him as he looked. It had
been needless to torture him so!</p>
<p>He came in sight of the familiar little farm-house
and turned in slowly at the break between
the trees. It was growing dark now, but the
odor of tobacco was on the air, and looking
closely, he could catch the gleam from a glowing
pipe-bowl in the doorway. He passed his
hand across his brow, almost doubting&ndash;&ndash;it was
all so like&ndash;&ndash;before&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A light step came tapping quickly down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
pathway toward him. &#8220;Guy!&#8221; a voice called
softly. &#8220;Guy, is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was quite near him now, and he
stopped short, a big maple above him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came up close, peering into the shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;Guy, where are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out and clasped her hand; then
again, and took both hands. Her breath came
quickly. Slowly his arm slipped about her
waist, she struggling a little against her own
will; then her head fell forward on his breast,
and he could feel her whole body tremble.</p>
<p>The man looked out through the rifts in the
half-naked trees; into the sky, clear and sparkling
beyond; on his face an expression of
sadness, of joy, of abandon&ndash;&ndash;all blended indescribably.</p>
<p>Two soft arms crept gently about his neck,
and a mass of fluffy hair caressed his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Guy! Guy!&#8221; sobbed the girl, &#8220;it&#8217;s
wicked, I know, but I&#8217;m so glad&ndash;&ndash;so glad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE DOMINANT IMPULSE</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Calmar Bye was a writer. That is
to say, writing was his vocation and his
recreation as well.</p>
<p>As yet, unfortunately, he had been unable
to find publishers; but for that deficiency no
reasonable person could hold him responsible.
He had tried them all&ndash;&ndash;and repeatedly. A
certain expressman now smiled when he saw
the long, slim figure approaching with a package
under his arm, which from frequent reappearances
had become easily recognizable; but
as a person becomes accustomed to a physical
deformity, Calmar Bye had ceased to notice
banter.</p>
<p>Of but one thing in his life he was positively
certain; and that was if Nature had fashioned
him for any purpose in particular, it was to do
the very thing he was doing now. The reason for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
this certainty was that he could do nothing else
with even moderate satisfaction. He had tried,
frequently, to break away, and had even succeeded
for a month at a time in an endeavor
to avoid writing a word; but inevitably there
came a relapse and a more desperate debauch
in literature. Try as he might he could not
avoid the temptation. An incident, a trifle out
of the ordinary in his commonplace life, a
sudden thrill at the reading of another man&#8217;s
story, a night of insomnia, and resolution was
in tatters, and shortly thereafter Calmar Bye&#8217;s
pencil would be coursing with redoubled vigor
over a sheet of virgin paper.</p>
<p>To be sure, Calmar did other things besides
write. Being a normal man with a normal appetite,
he could not successfully evade the
demands of animal existence, and when his
finances became unbearably low, he would proceed
to their improvement by whatever means
came first to hand. Book-keeping, clerical
work, stenography&ndash;&ndash;anything was grist for his
mill at such times, and for a period he would
work without rest. No better assistant could
be found anywhere&ndash;&ndash;until he had satisfied his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
few creditors and established a small surplus
of his own. Then, presto, change!&ndash;&ndash;and on the
surface reappeared Bye, the long, slender,
blue-eyed, dreaming, dawdling, irresponsible
writer.</p>
<p>Being what he was, the tenor of Calmar&#8217;s
life was markedly uneven. At times the lust
to write, the spirit of inspiration, as he would
have explained to himself in the privacy of his
own study, would come upon him strong, and
for hours or days life would be a joyous thing,
his fellow-men dear brothers of a happy family,
the obvious unhappiness and injustice about
him not reality, but mere comedy being enacted
for his particular delectation.</p>
<p>Then at last, his work finished, would
come inevitable reaction. The product of his
hand and brain, completed, seemed inadequate
and commonplace. He would smile grimly as
with dogged persistence he started this latest
child of his fancy out along the trail so thickly
bestrewn with the skeletons of elder offspring.
In measure, as badinage had previously passed
him harmlessly by, it now cut deeply. No one
in the entire town thought him a more complete
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
failure than he considered himself. Skies, from
being sunny, grew suddenly sodden; not a tenement
or alley but thrust obtrusively forward
its tale of misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of me,&#8221; he confided to his friend
Bob Wilson one evening as during his transit
through a particularly dismal slough of despond
they in company were busily engaged in blazing
the trail with empty bottles; &#8220;One such as I,
a man of thirty and of good health, without a
dollar or the prospect of a dollar, an income or
the prospect of an income, a home or the prospect
of a home, following a cold scent like the
one I am now on!&#8221; He snapped his finger
against the rim of his thin drinking glass until
it rang merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea, again, of a man such as I, untravelled,
penniless, self-educated, thinking to
compete with others who journey the world
over to secure material, and who have spent a
fortune in preparation for this particular
work.&#8221; He excitedly drained the contents of
the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s preposterous, childlike!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he brought
the frail trifle down to the table with an emphasis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
which was all but its destruction&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;imbecile!
I tell you I&#8217;m going to quit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit for good,&#8221; he repeated at the expression
on the other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Bob Wilson scrutinized his companion with
a critical eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waiter,&#8221; he said, speaking over his shoulder,
&#8220;waiter, kindly tax our credit further to
the extent of a couple of Havanas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sah,&#8221; acknowledged the waiter.</p>
<p>Silence fell; but Bob&#8217;s observation of his
friend continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are going to quit the fight?&#8221; he
commented at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;decidedly.</p>
<p>Wilson lit his cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have completed that latest&ndash;&ndash;production
on which you were engaged, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer scratched a match.</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And sent it on?&#8221;</p>
<p>A nod. &#8220;Yes, on to the furnace room.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile which approached a grin formed
over Bob&#8217;s big face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have hope of its acceptance, I trust?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>Calmar Bye blew a cloud of smoke far
toward the ceiling, and the smile, a shade grim,
was reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than hope,&#8221; laconically. &#8220;I have
certainty at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another pause followed and slowly the smile
vanished from the faces of both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; and the long Calmar straightened
in his chair, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been an ass. It&#8217;s all apparent,
too apparent, now. I&#8217;ve tried to compete
with the entire world, and I&#8217;m too small.
It&#8217;s enough for me to work against local competition.&#8221;
He meditatively flicked the ash
from his cigar with his little finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize that a lot of my friends&ndash;&ndash;women
friends particularly&ndash;&ndash;will say they always
knew I had no determination, wouldn&#8217;t stay
in the game until I won. They&#8217;re all alike in
this one particular, Bob; all sticklers for the
big lower jaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ve been shooting into
a covey of publishers for twelve years and never
have touched a feather. Perseverance is a good
quality, but there is such a thing as insanity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
He stared unconsciously at the portieres of the
booth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once and for all, I tell you I&#8217;m through,&#8221;
he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going at?&#8221; queried Bob,
sympathetically, a shade quizzically.</p>
<p>The long Calmar reached into his pocket with
deliberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read that.&#8221; He tossed a letter across the
tiny table.</p>
<p>Bob poised the epistle in his hand gingerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Dakota,&#8221; he commented, as he observed
the postmark. &#8220;Humph, I can&#8217;t make
out the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a town at all, only a postoffice.
Immaterial anyway,&#8221; explained Calmar, irritably.</p>
<p>The round-faced man unfolded the letter
slowly and read aloud:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My Dear Sir</span>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Your request, coming from a stranger, is
rather unusual; but if you really mean business,
I will say this: Provided you&#8217;re willing
to take hold and stay right with me, I&#8217;ll take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
you in and at the end of a half-year pay $75.00
per month. You can then put into the common
fund whatever part of your savings you wish
and have a proportionate interest in the herd.
Permit me to observe, however, that you will
find your surroundings somewhat different
from those amid which you are living at present,
and I should advise you to consider carefully
before you make the change.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 2.34375em;'>&#8220;Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>E. J. Douglass.</span>&#8221;</span><br /></p>
<p>Bob slowly folded the sheet, and tossed it
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what particular portion of that desert,
if I may ask, does your new employer reside?&#8221;
There was uncertainty in the speaker&#8217;s voice,
as of one who spoke of India or the islands of
the Pacific. &#8220;Likewise&ndash;&ndash;pardon my ignorance&ndash;&ndash;is
that herd he mentions&ndash;&ndash;buffalo?&#8221;</p>
<p>Calmar imperturbably returned the letter to
his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious, Robert. Douglass is a cattle
man west of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The river!&#8221; apostrophized Bob. &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
man juggles with mysteries. What river,
pray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Missouri, of course. Didn&#8217;t you ever
study geography?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; in humble apology.
&#8220;Is that,&#8221; vaguely, &#8220;what they call the Bad
Lands?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bye looked across at his friend, of a mind to
be indignant; then his good-nature triumphed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not so bad as that,&#8221; with a feeble
attempt at a pun. He paused to light a cigar,
and absent-minded as usual, continued in digression.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve dangled long enough, old man; too
long. I&#8217;m going to do something now. I start
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Wilson the skeptic, looked at his friend
again critically. Resolutions of reconstruction
he had heard before&ndash;&ndash;and later watched
their downfall; but this time somehow there
was a new element introduced. Perhaps, after
all&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waiter,&#8221; he called, &#8220;we&#8217;ll trifle with another
quart of extra-dry, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To your success,&#8221; he added to his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
across the table, when the waiter had
returned from his mission.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>A year passed around, as years have a
way of doing, and found Calmar Bye, the
city man, metamorphosed indeed. Bronzed,
bearded, corduroy-clothed, cigarette-smoking,&ndash;&ndash;for
cigars fifty miles from a railroad are a
curiosity,&ndash;&ndash;as the seasons are dissimilar, so
was he unlike his former inconsequent self.
In his every action now was a directness
and a purpose of which he had not even a
conception in his former existence.</p>
<p>Very, very thin upon us all is the veneer of
civilization; very, very swift is the reversion
to the primitive when opportunity presents.
Only twelve short months and this man, end
product of civilization, doer of nothing practical,
dreamer of dreams and recorder of fancies,
had become a positive force, a contributor
to the world&#8217;s food supply, a producer of meat.
What a satire, in a period of time of which
the shifting seasons could be counted upon one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
hand, to have vibrated from manuscript to beef,
and for the change to be seemingly unalterable!</p>
<p>To be sure there had been a struggle; a
period of travail while readjustment was being
established; a desperate sense of homesickness
at first view of the undulating, grass-covered,
horizon-bounded prairies; an insatiable need
of the shops, the theatres, the telephones, the
<i>caf&eacute;s</i>, the newspapers, all of which previously
had constituted everything that made life worth
living. But these emotions had passed away.
What evolvement of civilization could equal
the beauty of a dew-scented, sun-sparkling
prairie morning, or the grandeur of a soundless,
star-dotted prairie night, wherein the very limitlessness
of things, their immensity, was a never
ending source of wonder? Verily, all changes
and conditions of life have their compensations.</p>
<p>Calmar Bye, the one time listless, had
learned many things in this unheard-of world.</p>
<p>First of all, most insistent of all, he was impressed
with the overwhelming predominance
of the physical over the mental. Later, in practical
knowledge, he grew inured to the &#8220;feel&#8221;
of a native bucking broncho and the sound of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
mocking, human laughter after a stunning fall;
in direct evolution, the method of throwing a
steer and the odor of burnt hair and hide which
followed the puff of smoke where the branding
iron touched ceased to be cruel.</p>
<p>Last of all, highest evolvement of all, came
the absorption of revolver-lore under the instruction
of experts who made but pastime of
picking a jack-rabbit in its flight, or bringing a
kite, soaring high in air, tumbling precipitate
to earth. A wild life it was and a rough, but
fascinating nevertheless in its demonstration of
the overwhelming superiority of man, the animal,
in nerve and endurance over every other
live thing on earth.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, with the hand of
winter again pressed firmly upon the land, it
seemed time could do no more; that the adaptation
of the exotic to his new surroundings was
complete. Already the past life seemed a
thing interesting but aloof from reality, like
the fantastic exploits of a hero of fiction, and
the present, the insistently active, vital present,
the sole consideration of importance.</p>
<p>In the appreciation of the stoic indifference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
of the then West it was a slight incident which
overthrew. One cowboy, &#8220;Slim&#8221; Rawley, had
a particularly vicious broncho, which none but
he had ever been able to control, and which in
consequence, he prized as the apple of his eye.
During his temporary absence from the ranch
one day a <i>confr&egrave;re</i>, &#8220;Stiff&#8221; Warwick, had, in
a spirit of bravado, roped the &#8220;devil&#8221; and
instituted a contest of wills. The pony was
stubborn, the man likewise, and a battle royal
followed. As a buzzard scents carrion, other
cowboys anticipated sport, and a group soon
gathered. Ere minutes had passed the blood
of the belligerents was up, and they were battling
as for life, with a dogged determination
which would have lasted upon the part of either,
the man or the beast, until death. Rough
scenes and inhuman, Bye had witnessed until
<i>blas&eacute;</i>; but nothing before like this. The man
used quirt, rowel, and profanity like a fiend.
The pony, panting, quivering, bucking, struggling,
covered with foam and streaming with
blood, shrilled with the impotent anger of a
demon. Even the impassive cowboy spectators
from chaffing lapsed into silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>Of a sudden, loping easily over the frost-bound
prairie and following the winding trail
of a cowpath, appeared the approaching figure
of a horse and rider. It came on steadily, clear
to the gathered group, and stopped. An instant
and the newcomer understood the scene
and a curse sprang to his lips. Another instant
and his own mustang was spurred in close by
the strugglers. His right hand raised in air
and bearing a heavy quirt, descended; not
upon the broncho, but far across the cursing,
devilish face of the man, its rider. Then
swift as thought and simultaneously as twin
machines, the hands of the intruder and of the
struggling &#8220;buster&#8221; went to their hips.</p>
<p>The spectators held their breaths; not one
stirred. Before them they saw the hands
which had gone to hips flash up and forward
like pistons from companion cylinders, and
they saw two puffs of smoke like escaping
steam.</p>
<p>Smoothly, as a scene in a rehearsed play,
the reports mingled, the riders, scarcely ten
feet apart, tottered in their saddles, and slowly,
unconsciously resistant even in death, the two
bodies slipped to earth.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>But there the unison ended. The mustang
which &#8220;Slim&#8221; Rawley rode stood still in its
tracks; but before the spectators could rush
in, the &#8220;devil&#8221; broncho, relieved of the hand
upon the curb, sprang away, and with the
&#8220;buster&#8217;s&#8221; foot caught fast in the stirrup ran
squealing, kicking, crazy mad out over the
prairie, dragging by its side the limp figure of
its unseated enemy.</p>
<p>Calmar Bye watched the whole spectacle as
in a dream. So swift had been the action, so
fantastic the denouement, that he could not at
first reconcile it all with reality. He went
slowly over to the prostrate &#8220;Slim&#8221; Rawley,
whom the others had laid out decently upon the
ground, half expecting him to leap up and
laugh in their faces; but the already stiffening
figure with the fiendish scowl upon its face, was
convincing.</p>
<p>Besides,&ndash;&ndash;gods, the indifference of these
men to death! The party of onlookers were
already separating&ndash;&ndash;one division, mounted,
starting in pursuit of the escaping broncho,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
along the narrow trail made by the dragged
man; the others impassively reconnoitring for
spades and shovels, were stolidly awaiting the
breaking of the lock of frost-bound earth at
the hands of a big, red-shirted cowboy with a
pick!</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Bye,&#8221; suggested one toiler, &#8220;you&#8217;re
an eddicated man; say a prayer er something,
can&#8217;t ye, before we plant old &#8216;Slim.&#8217; He wa&#8217;nt
sech a bad sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tenderfoot complied, and said something&ndash;&ndash;he
never knew just what&ndash;&ndash;as the dry clods
thumped dully upon the huddled figure in the
old gunny sack. What he said must have been
good, for those present resisted with difficulty
a disposition to applaud.</p>
<p>This labor complete, the cowboys scattered,
miles apart, each to his division of the herd,
which for better range had been distributed
over a wide territory. Bye was in charge of the
home bunch, and sat long after the others had
left, upon the new-formed mound in the ranch
dooryard.</p>
<p>Far over the broad, rolling prairies, as yet
bare and frost-bound, the sun shone brightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
A half-mile away he could see his own herd
scattered and grazing. The stillness after the
sudden excitement was almost unbelievable.
Minutes passed by which dragged into an hour.
Over the face of the sun a faint haze began to
form and, unnoticeable to one not prairie-trained,
the air took on a sympathetic feel,
almost of dampness. A native would have
sensed a warning; but Calmar Bye, one time
writer, paid no heed. An instinct of his life,
one he had thought suppressed, a necessity imperative
as hunger, was gathering upon him
strongly&ndash;&ndash;the overwhelming instinct to portray
the unusual.</p>
<p>Under its guidance, as in a maze, he made his
way into the rough, unplastered shanty. Automatically
he found a pencil and collected some
scraps of coarse wrapping paper. Already the
opening words of the tale he had to tell were in
his mind, and sitting down by the greasy pine-board
table, he began to write.</p>
<p>Hours passed. Over the sun the haze thickened.
The whole sky grew sodden, the earth a
corresponding grayish hue. Now and anon
puffs of wind, like sudden breaths, stirred the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
dull air, and the short buffalo grass trembled
in anticipation. The puffs increased until their
direction became definite, and at last here and
there big, irregular feathers of snow drifted
languidly to earth.</p>
<p>Within the shanty the man wrote unceasingly.
Many fragments he covered and deposited,
an irregular heap, at his right hand.
At his left an adolescent mound of cigarette
stumps grew steadily larger. A cloud of tobacco
smoke over his head, driven here and
there by vagrant currents of air, gathered
denser and denser.</p>
<p>As the light failed, the writer unconsciously
moved the rough table nearer and nearer the
window until, blocked, it could go no farther.
To one less preoccupied the grating over the
uneven floor would have been startling. Once
just outside the door the waiting pony neighed
warningly&ndash;&ndash;and again. Upon the ledge beneath
the window-pane a tiny mound of snowflakes
began to take form; around the shanty
the rising wind mourned dismally.</p>
<p>The light failed by degrees, until the paper
was scarcely visible, and, brought to consciousness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the man rose to light a lamp. One look
about and he passed his hand over his forehead,
absently. Striding to the door, he flung it wide
open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he muttered in complex apostrophe.</p>
<p>To put on hat and top-coat was the act of a
moment. To release the tethered pony the work
of another; then swift as a great brown shadow,
out across the whitening prairie to the spot he
remembered last to have seen the herd, the delinquent
urged the willing broncho&ndash;&ndash;only to
find emptiness; not even the suggestion of a
trail.</p>
<p>Back and forth, through miles and miles of
country, in semi-circles ever widening, through
a storm ever increasing and with daylight
steadily diminishing, Calmar Bye searched
doggedly for the departed herd; searched until
at last even he, ignorant of the supreme terrors
of a South Dakota blizzard, dared not remain
out longer.</p>
<p>That he found his way back to the ranch yard
was almost a miracle. As it was, groping at
last in utter darkness, blinded by a sleet which
cut like dull knives, and buffeted by a wind like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
a hurricane, more dead than alive he stumbled
upon the home shanty and opening the door
drew the weary broncho in after him. Man and
beast were brothers on such a night.</p>
<p>Of the hours which followed, of moaning
wind and drifting sleet, nature kindly gave him
oblivion. Dead tired, he slept. And morning,
crisp, smiling, cloudless, was about him when
he awoke.</p>
<p>Rising, and scarcely stopping for a lunch,
the man again sallied forth upon his search,
wading through drifts blown almost firm
enough to bear the pony&#8217;s weight and alternate
spots wind-swept bare as a floor; while all about,
gorgeous as multiple rainbows, flashed mocking
bright the shifting sparkle from innumerable
frost crystals.</p>
<p>All the morning he searched, farther and
farther away, until the country grew rougher
and he was full ten miles from home. At last,
stopping upon a small hill to reconnoitre, the
searcher heard far in the distance a sound
he recognized and which sent his cheek pale&ndash;&ndash;the
faint dying wail of a wounded steer. It
came from a deep draw between two low hills,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
one cut into a steep ravine by converged floods
and hidden by the tall surrounding weeds. Bye
knew the place well and the significance of the
sound he heard. In a cattle country, after a
sudden blizzard, it could have but one meaning,
and that the terror of all time to animals wild
or domestic&ndash;&ndash;the end of a stampede.</p>
<p>Only too soon thereafter the searcher found
his herd. Upon the brow of a hill overlooking
the ravine he stopped. Below him, bellowing,
groaning, struggling, wounded, dying, and
dead&ndash;&ndash;a great mass of heavy bodies, mixed
indiscriminately&ndash;&ndash;bruised, broken, segmented,
blood-covered, horrible, lay the observer&#8217;s
trust, the wealth of his employer, his own hope
of regeneration, worse now than worthless
carrion. And the cause of it all, the sole excuse
for this delinquency, lay back there upon
a greasy table in the shanty&ndash;&ndash;a short scrawling
tale scribbled upon a handful of scrap
paper!</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m back, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall, thin Calmar Bye leaned back in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
chair and looked listlessly about the familiar
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, without a suggestion of emotion. It
seemed to him hardly credible that he had been
away from it all for a year and more. Nothing
was changed. Across the room the same
mirrors repeated the reflections he had observed
so many times before. Nearby were the same
booths and from within them came the same
laughter and chatter and suppressed song. Opposite
the tiny table the same man with the
broad, good-natured face was making critical,
smiling observation, as of yore. As ever, the
look recalled the visionary to the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back for good, Bob,&#8221; he repeated slowly.</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s attitude was far from being
that of a conquering hero returned; the sympathies
of the easy-going Robert, ever responsive,
were roused.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, old man?&#8221; he queried
tentatively. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you a success as a
broncho-buster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A success!&#8221; Calmar Bye stroked a long,
thin face with a long, thin hand. &#8220;A success!&#8221;
he repeated. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have been a worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
failure, Bob.&#8221; He paused a moment, smoothing
the table-cloth absently with his finger tips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Success!&#8221; once more, bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
even a mediocre at anything unless it is at what
I&#8217;m doing now, dangling and helping spend
the money some one else has worked all day to
earn.&#8221; He looked his astonished friend fair in
the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what an idiot, a worse
than idiot, I&#8217;ve made of myself,&#8221; and he began
the story of the past year.</p>
<p>Monotonously, unemotionally he told the
tale, omitting nothing, adding nothing; while
about him the sounds of the restaurant, the
tinkling of glassware, the ring of silver, the
familiar muffled pop of extracted corks, played
a soft accompaniment. Occasionally Bob
would make a comment or ask explanation of
something to him entirely new; but that was all
until near the end,&ndash;&ndash;where the delinquent
herder, coming swiftly to the brow of the hill,
looked down upon the scene in the ravine below.
Then Bob, the care-free, the pleasure-seeking,
raised a hand in swift protest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t describe it, please, old man,&#8221; he requested.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s voice ceased; over his thin features
fell the light of a queer little half-smile
which, instead of declaring itself, only provoked
Bob Wilson&#8217;s curiosity. In the silence
Bye, with a hand unaccustomed to the exercise,
made the familiar gesture that brought one of
the busy attendants to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the story you wrote&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; suggested
Wilson while they waited.</p>
<p>For answer Calmar Bye drew an envelope
from his pocket and tossed it across the table
to his friend. Wilson first noted that it bore
the return address of one of the country&#8217;s foremost
magazines; he then unfolded the letter
and read aloud:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Bye</span>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;The receipt of your two stories, &#8216;Storm
and Stampede&#8217; and &#8216;The Lonely Grave,&#8217; has
settled a troublesome question for us, namely:
What has become of Mr. Calmar Bye?</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;No doubt you will recall that our criticisms
of the material which you have submitted from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
time to time in the past, were directed chiefly
against faults arising out of your unfamiliarity
with your subjects. The present manuscripts
bear the best testimony that you have been
gathering your material at first hand. We
have the feeling, as we read, that every sentence
flows straight from the heart.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Now we want just such vivid, gripping,
red-blooded cross-sections of life as these, your

get enough of them. Therefore, instead of
making you a cash offer for these two stories,
we suggest that you first call at our office at
your earliest convenience. If agreeable, we
should like to arrange for a series of Western

keep you engaged for some time to come.</p>

<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</span><br /></p>
<p>The hands of the two friends clasped across
the table. No word disturbed the silence until
the forgotten waiter broke in impatiently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; o&#8217;der, sahs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Champagne&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;this time it was Calmar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Bye who gave it&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a quart. And be lively
about it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; Bob Wilson&#8217;s admiration
burst forth. &#8220;It is worth a whole herd of
steers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE STUFF OF HEROES</h2>
</div>
<p>Springtime on the prairies of South
Dakota. It is early morning, the sun is
not yet up, but all is light and even and soft
and all-surrounding, so that there are no
shadows. In every direction the gently rolling
country is dotted brown and white from the
incomplete melting of winter&#8217;s snows. In the
low places tiny streams of snow-water, melted
yesterday, sing low under the lattice-work
blanket the frost has built in the night. Nearby
and in the distance prairie-chickens are calling,
lonely, uncertain. Wild ducks in confused
masses, mere specks in the distance, follow low
over the winding curves of the river. High
overhead, flocks of geese in regular black
wedges, and brant, are flying northward, and
the breezy sound of flapping wings and of
voices calling, mingle in the sweetest of all
music to those who know the prairies&ndash;&ndash;Nature&#8217;s
morning song of springtime.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a country! Look there!&#8221; The big
man in the front seat of the rough, low wagon
pointed east where the sun rose slowly from
the lap of the prairie. The other men cleared
their throats as if to speak, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve lived sixty years without knowing,&#8221;
continued the first voice, musingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been West before, either,&#8221; admitted
De Young, simply.</p>
<p>They drove on, the trickling of snow-water
sounding around the wagon wheels.</p>
<p>The third man, Clark, pointed back in the
direction they had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did any one back there inquire what we
were doing?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow &#8216;lowed,&#8217; with a rising inflection,
that we were hunting ducks,&#8221; said De Young.
&#8220;I temporized; made him forget that I hadn&#8217;t
answered. You know what will happen once
the curiosity of the natives is aroused.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t approached,&#8221; Morris joined in,
without turning. The corners of the big man&#8217;s
mouth twitched, as the suggested picture
formed swiftly in his mind.</p>
<p>After a pause, De Young spoke again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I gave the postmaster a specially good tip
to see that we got our mail out promptly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; Clark admitted.</p>
<p>The face of the serious man lighted; and,
their eyes meeting, the three friends smiled all
together.</p>
<p>The sun rose higher, without a breath of
wind from over the prairies, and one after another
the men removed their top-coats. The
horses&#8217; hoofs splashed at each step in slush
and running water, sending drops against the
dashboard with a sound like rain.</p>
<p>The trail which they were following could
now scarcely be seen, except at intervals on
higher ground, where hoof-prints and the
tracks of wheels were scored in the soft mud,
and with each mile these marks grew deeper
and broader as the partly frozen earth
softened.</p>
<p>The air of solemnity which had hung about
the men for days, and which lifted from time
to time only temporarily, now silenced them
again. Indeed, had there been anybody
present to observe, he doubtless would have
been impressed most of all with the unwonted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
soberness of the wagon&#8217;s occupants, a gravity
strangely at variance with the rampant, fecund
season.</p>
<p>And the object of their journeying into this
unknown world was in all truth a matter for
silence rather than speech; its influence was
toward deep and earnest meditation, to which
the joyous, awakening world could do no more
than chant in a minor key a melancholy accompaniment.
Never did a soldier advancing
upon a breach in the enemy&#8217;s breastworks
more certainly confront the grinning face of
Death, than did this trio in their progress
across the singing prairie; but where the
plaudits of the world spelled glory for the
one, the three in the wagon knew that for
them Death meant oblivion, extinction, a
blotting out that must needs be utter and
inevitable.</p>
<p>The thoughts of each dwelt upon some aspect
of two scenes which had happened only
a brief fortnight previously. There had been
a notable convention of physicians in a city
many miles to the east. One delegate, a man
young, slender, firm of jaw, his face shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
with zeal and the spirit which courts self-immolation,
had addressed the body. His
speech had made a profound impression&ndash;&ndash;after
its first effect of sensation had subsided&ndash;&ndash;upon
the hundreds gathered there, who
hearkened amazedly; but of those hundreds
only two had been moved to lay aside the tools
of their calling and follow him.</p>
<p>And whither was he leading them? Into
the Outer Darkness, each firmly believed.
For them the future was spelled <i>nihil</i>; for
the world, salvation&ndash;&ndash;perhaps.</p>
<p>The inspired voice still rang in memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I repeat, it is a challenge....
The flag of the enemy is hung up
boldly, flauntingly, in every public place....
Are we to permit this? Are we to
sit idle and acknowledge ourselves beaten in
the great struggle against Death? No, no, no!
The Nation&ndash;&ndash;yea, the whole civilized world&ndash;&ndash;shrinks
and shudders in terror before the sound
of one dread word&ndash;&ndash;<i>tuberculosis</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;Our professional honor&ndash;&ndash;our personal
honor as well, gentlemen&ndash;&ndash;is at stake. A
solemn charge is laid upon us.... We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
must die if need be; but we must conquer this
monstrous scourge, which is the single cause of
more than one death in every ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, the deep silence which had
marked the closing words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I can cure consumption,&#8221; came
the simple declaration. &#8220;If there are those
among you who value Science more than gain;
who are willing to dare with me, willing to pay
the extreme price, if necessary&ndash;&ndash;if there are
any such among you, and I believe there are,
meet with me in my rooms this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the eight who accepted that invitation,
Dr. De Young disclosed the details of his Great
Experiment. It included, among many other
things which no one but a physician can appreciate,
the lending of their bodies to the Experiment&#8217;s
exemplification. Of the eight, two had
agreed to follow him to the end. Each of the
three had placed his house in order, and here
they were, nearing that end, whatever it was
to be.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and now ahead in the distance
a rough shanty came into view. It was
the only house in sight, and the three men knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
it was to be theirs. In silence they drew up
where the men were unpacking their goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning for ducks&ndash;&ndash;saw a big flock
of mallards back here in a pond,&#8221; observed the
man who took their team.</p>
<p>The three doctors alighted without answering,
and watching them, the man stroked a
stubby red whisker in meditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, they&#8217;re a frost!&#8221; he commented.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Night had come, and the stars shone early
from a sky yet light and warm. In the low
places the waters sang louder than before, with
the increase of a day&#8217;s thawing. Looking away,
the white spots were smaller and the brown
patches larger; otherwise, all was the same, the
prairie of yesterday, of to-day, and to-morrow.</p>
<p>Tired with a day of settling, the three men
stood in the doorway and for the first time
viewed the country at night. They were not
talkers at best, and now the immensity of the
broad prairies held them silent. The daily
struggle of life, the activity and rivalry and
ambition which before to-night had seemed so
great to these city-bred men, here alone with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Nature and Nature&#8217;s God, where none other
might see, assumed their true worth. The
tangled web of life loosened and many foreign
things caught and held therein, fell out. Man,
introspecting, saw himself at his real worth, and
was not proud.</p>
<p>The absolute quiet, so unusual, made them
wakeful, and though tired, they sat long in the
doorway, smoking, thinking. Small talk
seemed to them profanation, and of that
which was uppermost in each man&#8217;s mind,
none cared first to speak. A subtle understanding,
called telepathy, was making of their
several minds a thing united.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not to-night, it&#8217;s too beautiful,&#8221; said
De Young at length, and the protesting voice
sounded to his own ears as that of a stranger.</p>
<p>The men started at the sound, and the glowing
tips of three cigars described partial arcs in
the half light as they turned each to each. No
one answered. They were face to face with
fundamentals at last.</p>
<p>Minutes, an hour, passed. The cigars burned
out, and as the pleasant odor of tobacco died
away, there came the chill night air of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
prairie. The two older men rose stiffly, and
with a low good-night, stumbled into the darkness
of the shanty.</p>
<p>De Young sat alone in the doorway. He
realized that it was the supreme hour of his life.
In his mind, memory of past and hope of future
met on the battlefield of the present, and meeting,
mingled in chaos. Thoughts came crowding
upon each other thick&ndash;&ndash;the thoughts which
come to few more than once in life, to multitudes,
never; the thoughts which writers in every
language, during all time, have sought words to
express, and in vain.</p>
<p>Everywhere the snow-streams sang lower and
lower. A fog, dense, penetrating, born of early
morning, wrapped all things about, uniting and
at the same time setting apart. Shivering, he
shut the door on the night and the damp, and as
by instinct crept into bed. Listening in the
darkness, the sound of the sleepers soothed him.
Happier thoughts came, thoughts which made
his heart beat more swiftly and his eyes grow
tender; for he was yet young, and love untold
ever dwelleth near heaven. Thus he fell asleep
with a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Choose, please. We&#8217;ll take our turns in the
order of length,&#8221; said De Young, holding up
the ends of three paper strips. Each man drew,
and in the silence that followed, without a word
Morris turned away, preparing swiftly for the
operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me chloroform,&#8221; he said, stretching
himself horizontally,&ndash;&ndash;adding as the others
bent over him, &#8220;Inoculate deep, please. Let&#8217;s
not waste time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly, with the precision of absolute knowledge,
the two physicians did their work. A mist
was over their eyes, so that all the room looked
dim, as to old men; and hands which had not
known a tremor for years, shook as they emptied
the contents of the little syringe, teeming with
tiny, unseen, living rods. Clark&#8217;s forehead was
damp with a perspiration that physical pain
could not have brought, and on De Young&#8217;s
face, time marked those minutes as months.</p>
<p>It was all done with the habit of years. The
two doctors carefully sterilized their instruments
and replaced them in cases, then, silently,
drawn nearer together than ever before, the
two friends watched the return of consciousness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
And Morris awakening, things real and of
dreamland still confused to his senses, heard the
soft voice which a legion of patients had thus
heard and blessed, saying cheerily, &#8220;Wake up!
wake up, my friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the day passed. In turn, the men, hours
apart, with active brains, and eyes wide open,
sent their challenges to Death&ndash;&ndash;each man his
own messenger.</p>
<p>The months slipped by. Suns became torrid
hot, and cooled until it seemed there was light
but not heat on earth. Days grew longer, and
in unison, earth waxed greener; then in descending
scale, both together waned. Migratory
wings fluttering at night, and passing voices
calling in the darkness&ndash;&ndash;most lonely sounds of
earth&ndash;&ndash;gave place to singers of the day. The
robin, the meadow-lark, the ubiquitous catbird,
all born of prairie and of summer, came and
went. Blackbirds in countless flocks followed.
Again the calling of prairie-chickens was heard
at eve and morning, and anon frost glistened in
the air.</p>
<p>At last throughout the land no sound of
animal voice was heard, for winter bound all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
things firm and white. Another cycle was complete;
yet, almost ere the record could be made,
there appeared, moving far in the distance, a
black triangle. Passing swiftly, with the sound
of wings and calling voices, there sprang anew
in all things animate a mixed feeling of gladness
and unrest, which was the spirit of returned
spring.</p>
<p>Thus twice the cycle of the seasons passed,
and again the sun of early spring, shining
bright, set the tiny snow-streams singing. It
glistened over the prairie on snow-drift and
frost; it lit up the few scattered shingled roofs
of settlers newly come; and shone in at the
open door of a rough cabin we know, touching
without pity the faces of the two men who
watched its rise. Shining low, even with the
prairie, it touched in vivid contrast an oblong
mound of fresh earth, heaped up target distance
from the cabin door.</p>
<p>The mound had not been there long; neither
snow or rain had yet touched it; it was still
strange to the men in the doorway, who saw it
vividly now, at time of sunrise. Though thus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
early, each man sat idly smoking, an open book
reversed on the knee.</p>
<p>De Young first broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must do something, or else decide to do
nothing about Clark&#8217;s mail.&#8221; He shifted in his
seat, looking away from the open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;whether&ndash;&ndash;it would be
kinder to tell them or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>A coughing fit shook Morris, and answering,
a twitch as of pain tightened the corners of his
companion&#8217;s eyes. Minutes passed, and Morris
sat limply in his chair, before he answered,</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought at first we&#8217;d better write; now it
seems different. Let&#8217;s wait until we go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of the men looked at the other. They
seldom did now; it was useless pain. Filled with
the incomparable optimism of the consumptive,
neither man realized his own condition, but
marked the days of his friend. Morris, unbelieving,
spoke of his friend&#8217;s return; yet, growing
weaker each day himself, spoke in all hope
and conviction of his future work, recording
each day his mode of successful treatment, despite
interruptions of coughing which left him
breathless and trembling for minutes. De
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Young saw, and in pity marvelled; yet, seeing,
and as a physician knowing, he not for a moment
applied the gauge to himself.</p>
<p>Nature, in sportive mood, commands the
Angel of Death, who with matchless legerdemain,
keeps the mirror of illusion, unsuspected,
before the consumptive&#8217;s eyes; and, seeing, in
derision the satirist smiles.</p>
<p>Unavoidably acting parts, the two friends
found a barrier of artificiality separating them,
making each happier when alone. Thus day
after day, monotonous, unchanging, went by.
Not another person entered their door. From
the little town a man at periods brought provisions
and their mail, but the house was acquiring
an uncanny reputation. They were
not understood, and such are ever foreign.
With the passage of time and the coming of
the mound in the dooryard, the feeling had
developed into positive fear, and travellers
avoided the place as though warned by a scarlet
placard.</p>
<p>Morris grew weaker daily. At last the disillusionment
that precedes death came to him.
The artificial slipped from both men and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
nearness like that of brothers, joined them.
They spoke not of the future but of the past.
Years slipped aside and left them back in the
midst of active, brain-satisfying practice. Over
again they performed operations, where life
and death were separated but by a hair&#8217;s
width. Again, with eyes that brightened and
breath that came more quickly, they lived their
successes, and hand in hand, as children in the
dark, told of their failures, and the tale was
long, for they were but men.</p>
<p>The end came quietly. A hemorrhage, a
big spot of blood on the cover, a firm hand
pressure, and Morris&#8217;s parting words,</p>
<p>&#8220;Save my notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night De Young knew no sleep. &#8220;I
must finish the work,&#8221; he said, in lame excuse.
Well he knew there could be no rest for him
that night. He did his task thoroughly, making
record of things that had passed, with the precision
of a physician who knows a patient but
as material.</p>
<p>A tramp, who, unknowing, had taken shelter
in an outbuilding, waking in the night, saw the
light. Moved by curiosity, he crawled up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
softly in the darkness, and peeped in at the
window. In the half light he saw on the bed
a thin, white face motionless in the expression
which even he knew was death; and at the
table, writing rapidly with manuscript all
about, a man whose eyes shone with the brilliancy
of disease, and with a face as pale as the
face on the pillow. In the blank, unreasoning
terror of superstition, he fled until Nature rebelled
and would carry him no farther. Next
day to all he saw, he told the tale of supernatural
things which lingers yet around a
prairie ruin, in whose dooryard are mounds
built of man.</p>
<p>The mail carrier calling next day saw a man
with spots of scarlet heightening the contrast
of a face pale as death, digging in the dooryard.
The man worked slowly, for he coughed
often and must rest. In kindness the carrier
offered help, but was refused with words that
brought to the listener&#8217;s eyes a moisture unknown
since boyhood, and the thought of which
in days that followed, kept him silent concerning
what he had seen.</p>
<p>Summer, with the breath of warm life and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the odor of growing things; with days made
dreamy and thoughtful by the purring of the
soft wind and the droning of insects; and nights
when all was good; with stars above and crickets
singing below&ndash;&ndash;summer had come and was
passing.</p>
<p>De Young could no longer deceive himself.
The personal faith that had upheld him so long&ndash;&ndash;when
friends had failed&ndash;&ndash;could fight the
inevitable no longer. With eyes wide open,
he saw at last clearly, and, seeing, realized the
end. He cared not for death; he was too strong
for that; but it must needs be that, now, with
the shadow of defeat lying dark over the future,
the problem of motive, the great &#8220;why,&#8221;
should come uppermost in his mind demanding
an answer.</p>
<p>Once before, at the time when other men
read from their lives, he caught glimpses of
something beyond. Now again the mood returned,
and he knew why he was as he was;
that with him love was, and had been, stronger
than Science and all else beside. He knew that
whatever he might have done, the entering
into his life of The Woman, and the knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
that followed her coming, had inspired the
supreme motive that thenceforth drove him forward.
With this realization came a new life,
a happier and a sadder life, in which all things
underwent readjustment.</p>
<p>Regret came as sadness, regret that he had
not told this woman all; that in his blind confidence
he had not written, but had waited&ndash;&ndash;waited
for this. He would wait no longer. He
would tell her now. A thousand new thoughts
came to his mind; a thousand new feelings
surged over him as a flood, and he poured them
out on paper. The man himself, not the physician,
was unfolded for the first time in his life,
and the writing of that letter which told all,
his life, his love, that ended with a good-bye
which was forever, was the sweetest labor of
his life. He sealed the letter and sat for hours
looking at it, dreaming.</p>
<p>It was summer and the nights were short,
so that with the writing and the dreams, morning
had come. He could scarce wait that day
for the carrier; time to him had become suddenly
a thing most precious; and when at last
the man appeared. De Young twice exacted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
promise that the letter should be mailed special
delivery.</p>
<p>The reaction was on and all the world was
dark. Fool that he was, two years had passed
since he had heard from her. She also was a
consumptive; might not&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>The very thought was torture; perspiration
started at every pore, and with the little
strength that was left he paced up and down
the room like a caged animal. A fit of coughing,
such as he had never known before, seized
him, and he dropped full length upon the bed.</p>
<p>The limit was reached; he slept.</p>
<p>As he had worked one night before to forget,
so he spent the following days. It was the
end, and he knew it; but he no longer cared.
His future was centred on one event&ndash;&ndash;the
coming of a letter. Beyond that all was
shadow, and he cared not to explore. He
worked all that Nature would allow, carrying
to completion his observations, admitting his
mistake with a candor which now caused no
personal pain. He spent much time at his
journal, writing needless things: his actions,
his very thoughts,&ndash;&ndash;things which could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
have been wrung from him before; but he was
lonely and desperate. He must not think&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;t
was madness. So he wrote and wrote and
wrote.</p>
<p>He watched for the carrier all the daylight
hours. His mail was light, and the coming infrequent.
There had been time for an answer,
and the watcher could no longer compose himself
to write. All day he sat in the doorway,
looking across the two mounds, down the road
whence the carrier would come.</p>
<p>And at last he came. Far down the road
toward town one morning a familiar moving
figure grew distinct. De Young watched as
though fascinated. He wanted to shout, to
laugh, to cry. With an effort that sent his
finger nails deep into his palms, he kept quiet,
waiting.</p>
<p>A letter was in the carrier&#8217;s hand. Struck
by the look on De Young&#8217;s face, the postman
did not turn, but stood near by watching. The
exile, once the immovable, seized the missive
feverishly, then paused to examine. It was a
man&#8217;s writing he held, and he winced as at a
blow, but with a hand that was nerved too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
high to tremble, he tore open the envelope. He
read the few words, and read again; then in a
motion of weariness and hopelessness indescribable,
hands and paper dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! And she never knew,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>When next the carrier came, he shaped the
third mound.</p>

<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter I&ndash;&ndash;Prelude</span></h3>
<p>Silence, the silence of double doors and
of padded walls was upon the private room
of the down-town office. Across the littered,
ink-stained desk a man and a woman faced
each other. Threads of gray lightened the hair
of each. Faint lines, delicate as pencillings,
marked the forehead of the woman and radiated
from the angles of her eyes. A deep fissure
unequally separated the brows of the man,
and on his shaven face another furrow added
firmness to the mouth. Their eyes met squarely,
without a motion from faces imperturbable in
middle age and knowledge of life.</p>
<p>The man broke silence slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; he hesitated, &#8220;what that would
seem to mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; A shade of resentment was
in the answering voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re a woman&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And married&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The note of resentment became positive.
&#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to.&#8221; The man spoke almost mechanically.
&#8220;You took oath before man and
higher than man&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman interrupted him shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another took oath with me and broke it.&#8221;
She leaned gracefully forward in the big chair
until their eyes met. &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you!&#8221; she interjected.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyebrows lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love?&#8221; he inflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, love. What is love but good friendship&ndash;&ndash;and
sex?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was silent.</p>
<p>A strong white hand slid under the woman&#8217;s
chin and her elbow met the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant what you thought,&#8221; she completed
slowly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I cannot&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It destroys all my ideas of things. Your
promise to another&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say he&#8217;s broken his promise to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your being a woman&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you expect more of me because
I&#8217;m a woman? Haven&#8217;t I feelings, rights, as
well as you who are a man?&#8221; She waited until
he looked up. &#8220;I ask you again, won&#8217;t you
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man arose and walked slowly back and
forth across the narrow room. At length he
stopped by her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>In swift motion his companion stood up
facing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish to?&#8221; she challenged.</p>
<p>The hand of the man dropped in outward
motion of deprecation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is useless. I&#8217;m human.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we do what pleases us,
then?&#8221; The voice was insistent. &#8220;What is
life for if not for pleasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be pleasure, though? Wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the future hold for us more of pain than of
pleasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, never.&#8221; The words came with a slowness
that meant finality. &#8220;Why need to-morrow
or a year from now be different from
to-day unless we make it so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would change unconsciously. We&#8217;d
think and hate ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what reason? Isn&#8217;t it Nature that attracts
us to each other and can Nature be
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t always depend upon Nature,&#8221;
commented the man absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an artificial argument, and you
know it.&#8221; A reprimand was in her voice. &#8220;If
you can&#8217;t depend upon Nature to tell you what
is right, what other authority can you consult?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Nature has been perverted,&#8221; he evaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it possible your judgment instead is
at fault?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be at fault, here.&#8221; The voice was
neutral as before. &#8220;Something tells us both
it would be wrong&ndash;&ndash;to do&ndash;&ndash;as we want to do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>Once more they sat down facing each other,
the desk between them as at first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Artificial convention, I tell you again.&#8221;
In motion graceful as nature the woman extended
her hand, palm upward, on the polished
desk top. &#8220;How could we be other than right?
What do we mean by right, anyway? Is there
any judge higher than our individual selves,
and don&#8217;t they tell us pleasure is the chief aim
of life and as such must be right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The muscles at the angle of the man&#8217;s jaw
tightened involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But pleasure is not the chief end of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Development&ndash;&ndash;evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evolution to what?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That we cannot answer as yet. Future
generations must and will give answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for this then that you deny yourself?&#8221;
A shade almost of contempt was in the questioning
voice.</p>
<p>The taunt brought no change of expression
to the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman walked over to a bookcase, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
drawing out a volume, turned the pages absently.
Without reading a word, she came
back and looked the man squarely in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will denying yourself help the world to
evolve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My determination makes me a positive
force. It is my Karma for good, that makes
my child stronger to do things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have no child,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;swiftly.</p>
<p>Their eyes met again without faltering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have&ndash;&ndash;sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence fell upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you a century ago?&#8221; digressed
the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will your child be a hundred years
from now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead likewise, probably; but the force for
good, the Karma of the life, will be passed on
and remain in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unconsciously they both rose to their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was man always on the earth?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>The question was answered almost before
spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he always be here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Science says &#8216;no.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman came a step forward until they
almost touched.</p>
<p>&#8220;What then becomes of your life of denial?&#8221;
she challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make it hard for me,&#8221; said the man,
simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;But am I not right?&#8221; She came toward
him passionately. &#8220;I come near you, and you
start.&#8221; She laid her hand on his. &#8220;I touch
you, and your eyes grow warm. Both our
hearts beat more quickly. Look at the sunshine!
It&#8217;s brighter when we&#8217;re so close together.
What of life? It&#8217;s soon gone&ndash;&ndash;and
then? What of convention that says &#8216;no&#8217;?
It&#8217;s but a farce that gives the same thing we
ask&ndash;&ndash;at the price of a few words of mummery.
Our strongest instincts of nature call for each
other. Why shouldn&#8217;t we obey them when
we wish?&#8221; She hesitated, and her voice became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
tender. &#8220;We would be very happy together.
Won&#8217;t you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man broke away almost roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;it&#8217;s madness
for us to be talking like this? We&#8217;ll be
taking it seriously, and then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman made a swift gesture of protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s be honest&ndash;&ndash;with each other,
at least. I&#8217;m tired of pretending to be other
than I am. Why did you say &#8216;being true to
my husband&#8217;? You know it&#8217;s mockery. Is it
being true to live with a man I hate because
man&#8217;s law demands it, rather than true to you
whom Nature&#8217;s law sanctions? Don&#8217;t speak to
me of society&#8217;s right and wrong! I despise it.
There is no other tribunal than Nature, and
Nature says &#8216;Come.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man sat down slowly and dropped his
head wearily into his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say again, I cannot. I respect you too
much. We&#8217;re intoxicated now being together.
In an hour, after we&#8217;re separate&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke in on him passionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think a woman says what I have
said on the spur of the moment? Do you think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
I merely happened to see you to-day, merely
happened to say what I&#8217;ve said? You know
better. This has been coming for months. I
fought it hard at first; with convention, with
your idea of right and wrong. Now I laugh
at them both. Life is life, and short, and beyond
is darkness. Think what atoms we are;
and we struggle so hard. Our life that seems
to us so short&ndash;&ndash;and so long! A thousand,
perhaps ten thousand such, end to end, and we
have the life of a world. And what is that?
A cycle! A thing self-created, self-destructive:
then of human life&ndash;&ndash;nothingness. Oh,
it&#8217;s humorous! Our life, a ten thousandth
part of that nothingness; and so full of tiny&ndash;&ndash;great
struggles and worries!&#8221; She was
silent a moment, her throat trembling, a multitude
of expressions shifting swiftly on her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe in God?&#8221; she questioned
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know. There must be&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose, then, He&#8217;s laughing at
us now?&#8221; She hesitated again and then went
on, almost unconsciously. &#8220;I had a dream a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
few nights ago.&#8221; The voice was low and very
soft. &#8220;It seemed I was alone in a desert place,
and partial darkness was about me. I was
conscious only of listening and wondering, for
out of the shadow came sounds of human suffering.
I waited with my heart beating
strangely. Gradually the voices grew louder,
until I caught the meaning of occasional words
and distinctly saw coming toward me the figure
of a man and a woman bearing a great burden,
a load so great that both together bent beneath
the weight and sweat stood thick upon their
brows. The edges of the burden were very
sharp so that the hands of the man and the
woman bled from the wounds and their shoulders
were torn grievously where the load had
shifted: those of the woman more than the
man, for she bore more of the weight. I
marvelled at the sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly an intense brightness fell about
me and I saw, near and afar, other figures each
bearing similar burdens. The light passed
away, and I drew near the man and questioned
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What rough load is that you carry?&#8217; I
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The burden of conventionality,&#8217; answered
the man, wearily and with a note of surprise
in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why do you bear it needlessly?&#8217; I remonstrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We dare not drop it,&#8217; said the woman,
hopelessly, &#8216;lest that light, which is the searchlight
of public opinion, return, showing us different
from the others.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even as she spoke the illumination again
fell upon us, and by its brightness I saw a drop
of blood gather slowly from the wounds on the
woman&#8217;s hand and fall into the dust at her
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the inmates of the tiny
muffled office.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the burden isn&#8217;t useless,&#8221; said the man,
gently. &#8220;The condemnation of society is an
hourly reality. From the patronage of others
we live. The sun burns us, but we submit, for
in return it gives life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman arose with an abrupt movement,
and looked down at him coldly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a man, and use those arguments?&#8221;
An expression akin to contempt formed about
her mouth. &#8220;Are you afraid of a united voice
the individuals of which you despise?&#8221;</p>
<p>The first hint of restrained passion was in
the answering voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You taunt me in safety, for you know I
love you.&#8221; He looked up at her unhesitatingly.
&#8220;Man&#8217;s law is artificial, that I know; but it&#8217;s
made for conditions which are artificial, and
for such it&#8217;s right. Were we as in the beginning,
Nature&#8217;s law, which beside the law of man
is no law, would be right; but we&#8217;re of the
world as it is now. Things are as they are, and
we must conform or pay the price.&#8221; He hesitated.
His face settled back into a mask. &#8220;And
that price of non-conformity is too high,&#8221; he
completed steadily.</p>
<p>The eyes of the woman blazed and her hands
tightened convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re frozen&ndash;&ndash;fossilized, man! I
called you man! You&#8217;re not a man at all, but
a nineteenth century machine! You&#8217;re run
like a motor, from a power house; by the force
of conventional thought, over wires of red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
tape. Fie on you! I thought to meet a human
being, not a lifeless thing.&#8221; She looked at him
steadily, her chin in the air, a world of scorn
in her face. &#8220;Go on sweating beneath the useless
load! Go on building your structure of
artificiality that ends centuries from now in
nothingness! Here&#8217;s happiness to you in your
empty life of self-effacement, with your machine
prompted acts, years considered!&#8221; Without
looking at him, one hand made scornful
motion of dismissal. &#8220;Good-bye, ghost of man;
I wash my hands of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Eleanor!&#8221; The man sprang to his
feet, the mask lifting from his face, and there
stood revealed a multitude of emotions, unseen
of the world, that flashed from the depths of
his brown eyes and quivered in the angles of
his mouth. He came quickly over and took her
hand between his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a world of tenderness
was in his voice&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;unspeakably proud&ndash;&ndash;for
I love you. I&#8217;ve done my best to keep us
apart, yet all the time I believed with you.
Nature is higher than man, and no power on
earth can prove it otherwise.&#8221; He looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
into the softest of brown eyes, and his voice
trembled. &#8220;Beside you the world is nothing.
Its approval or its condemnation are things to
be laughed at. With you I challenge
conventionality&ndash;&ndash;society&ndash;&ndash;everything.&#8221; He bent
over her hand almost reverently and touched
it softly with his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell&ndash;&ndash;until I come,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter II&ndash;&ndash;The Leap</span></h3>
<p>A man and a woman emerged from the
dilapidated day-car as it drew up before
the tiny, sanded station which marked the
terminus of the railway. The man was tall,
clean-shaven, quick of step and of glance. The
woman was likewise tall, well-gloved, and,
strange phenomenon at a country station, carried
no parcels.</p>
<p>Though easily the centre of attention, the
couple were far from being alone. On the
contrary, the car and platform fairly swarmed
with humanity. Men mostly composed the
throng that alighted&ndash;&ndash;big, weather-stained
fellows in rough jeans and denims. In the
background, as spectators moved or lounged a
sprinkling of others: thinner, lighter, enveloped
in felt, woollen and buckskin, a fringe of heavy
hair peeping out at their backs beneath the
broad hat-brims. A few women were intermingled.
Coarsely gowned, sun-browned, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
stood; themselves like suns, but each the centre
of a system of bleach-haired minor satellites. It
was into this heterogeneous mass that the tall
man elbowed his way, a neat grip in either hand;
the woman following closely in his wake, her
skirts carefully lifted.</p>
<p>Clear of the out-flowing stream the man put
down the satchels, and looked over the heads of
the motley crowd into the still more motley
street beyond. Two short rows of one-story
buildings, distinctive by the brightness of new
lumber on their sheltered side, bordered a narrow
street, half clogged by the teams of visiting
farmers. Not the faintest clue to a hostelry
was visible, and the eyes of the man wandered
back, interrupting by the way another pair of
eyes frankly inquisitive.</p>
<p>The curious one was short; by comparison
his face was still shorter, and round. From his
chin a tiny tuft of whiskers protruded, like the
handle of a gourd. Never was countenance
more unmistakably labelled good-humored,
Americanized German.</p>
<p>The eyes of the tall man stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a hotel in this&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he groped for a
classification&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;this city?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>A rattling sound, startlingly akin to the agitated
contents of over-ripe vegetables, came
from somewhere in the internal mechanism of
the small man. Inferentially, the inquiry was
amusing to the questioned, likewise the immediately
surrounding listeners who became suddenly
silent, gazing at the stranger with the
wonder of young calves.</p>
<p>At length the innate spirit of courtesy in the
German triumphed over his amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hans Becher up by the postoffice takes
folks in.&#8221; The inward commotion showed indications
of resumption. &#8220;I never heard,
though, that he called his place a hotel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and the circle of silence
widened.</p>
<p>The man and the woman walked up the
street. Beneath their feet the cottonwood sidewalk,
despite its newness, was warped in agony
under sun and storm. Big puddles of water
from a recent rain stood in the hollows of the
roadway, side by side with tufts of native
grasses fighting bravely for life against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
intruder&ndash;&ndash;Man. A fresh, indescribable odor
was in their nostrils; an odor which puzzled
them then, but which later they learned to
recognize and never forgot&ndash;&ndash;the pungent
scent of buffalo grass. A stillness, deeper than
of Sabbath, unbelievable to urban ears, wrapped
all things, and united with an absence of broken
sky line, to produce an all-pervading sense of
loneliness.</p>
<p>Hans Becher did not belie his name. He was
very German. Likewise the little woman who
courtesied at his side. Ditto the choice assortment
of inquisitive tow-heads, who stared wide-eyed
from various corners. He shook hands
at the door with each of his guests,&ndash;&ndash;which
action also was unmistakably German.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would in my house&ndash;&ndash;put up, you
call it?&#8221; he inquired in labored English, while
the little woman polished two speckless chairs
with her apron, and with instinctive photographic
art placed them stiffly side by side for
the visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;d like to stay with you for a time,&#8221;
corroborated the tall man.</p>
<p>The little German ran his fingers uncertainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
through his hair for a moment; then his round
face beamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should then become to each other
known. Is it not so?&#8221; Without pausing for
an answer, he put out a big hand to each in turn.
&#8220;I am Hans Becher, and this&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with elaborate
indications&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;this my wife is&ndash;&ndash;Minna.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minna courtesied dutifully, lower than before.
The little Bechers were not classified,
but their connection was apparent. They
calmly sucked their thumbs.</p>
<p>The lords of creation obviously held the rostrum.
It was the tall man who responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Maurice, Ichabod Maurice.&#8221;
He looked at the woman, his companion, from
the corner of his eye. &#8220;Allow me, Camilla, to
present Mr. Becher.&#8221; Then turning to his
hosts, &#8220;Camilla Maurice: Mr. and Mrs.
Becher.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall lady shook hands with each.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased to meet you,&#8221; she said, and smiled
a moment into their eyes. Thus Camilla Maurice
made friends.</p>
<p>There were a few low-spoken words in German
and Minna vanished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She will dinner make ready,&#8221; Hans explained.</p>
<p>The visitors sat down in their chairs, with
Hans opposite studying them narrowly; singly
and together.</p>
<p>&#8220;The town is very new,&#8221; suggested Ichabod.</p>
<p>&#8220;One year ago it was not.&#8221; The German&#8217;s
short legs crossed each other nervously and
their owner seized the opportunity to make
further inspection. &#8220;It is very new,&#8221; he repeated
absently.</p>
<p>Camilla Maurice stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might we wash, Mr. Becher?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The ultimate predicament was all at once
staring the little man in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure.... I might have known....
You will a room&ndash;&ndash;desire.&#8221; ...
He ran his fingers through his hair, and inspiration
came. &#8220;Mr. Maurice,&#8221; he motioned,
&#8220;might I a moment with you&ndash;&ndash;speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Becher.&#8221;</p>
<p>The German saw light, and fairly beamed
as he sought the safe seclusion of the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is your sister or cousin&ndash;&ndash;<i>nein</i>?&#8221; he
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>There was the faintest suggestion of a smile
in the corners of Ichabod&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she is neither my sister nor my cousin,
Mr. Becher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans heaved a sigh of relief: it had been a
close corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is your wife. One must know,&#8221; and
he mopped his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&ndash;&ndash;one must know,&#8221; very soberly.</p>
<p>Alone together in the little unfinished room
under the rafters, the woman sat down on the
corner of the bed, physical discomfort forgotten
in feminine curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those names&ndash;&ndash;where did you get them?&#8221;
she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came to me&ndash;&ndash;at the moment,&#8221; smiled
the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the cold-blooded horror of them!...
Ichabod!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The glory has departed.&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion started, and the smile left
the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Camilla?&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attendant at a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of a sudden the room became very still.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>Ichabod, exploring, discovered a tiny wash
basin and a bucket of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wished to wash, Camilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were very kind&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she looked
through the window with the tiny panes:
&#8220;have we any right to&ndash;&ndash;lie to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not lied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tacitly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m Ichabod Maurice and you&#8217;re
Camilla Maurice. We have not lied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The past is dead, dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face dropped into her hands.
Woman ever weeps instinctively for the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sorry that it is&ndash;&ndash;so?&#8221; There
was no bitterness in the man&#8217;s voice, but he did
not look at her, and Camilla misunderstood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221; She came close, and a soft warm
face pressed tightly against his face. &#8220;Sorry!&#8221;
Her arms were around him. &#8220;Sorry!&#8221; again
repeated. &#8220;No! No! No! No, without end!
I&#8217;m not sorry. I&#8217;m Camilla Maurice, the happiest
woman in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later they utilized the tin basin and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
mirror with a crack across its centre. Dinner
was waiting when they went below.</p>
<p>To a casual observer, Hans had been very
idle while they were gone. He sat absently on
the doorstep, watching the grass that grew
almost visibly in the warm spring sun. Occasionally
he tapped his forehead with his finger
tips. It helped him to think, and just now he
sadly needed assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were these people, anyway?&#8221; he
wondered. Not farmers, certainly. Farmers
did not have hands that dented when you
pressed them, and farmers&#8217; wives did not lift
their skirts daintily from behind. Hans had
been very observant as his visitors came up the
muddy street. No, that was not the way of
farmers&#8217; wives: they took hold at the sides
with both hands, and splashed right through
on their heels.</p>
<p>Hans pulled the yellow tuft on his chin.
What could they be, then? Not summer
boarders. It was only early spring; and, besides,
although the little German was an
optimist, even he could not imagine any one
selecting a Dakota prairie for an outing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Yet ... No, they could not be summer
boarders.</p>
<p>But what then? In his intensity Hans
actually forgot the grass and, unfailing producer
of inspiration, ran his fingers frantically
through his mane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;at last&ndash;&ndash;of course!&#8221; The round
face beamed and a hard hand smote a harder
knee, joyously. That he had not remembered
at once! It was the new banker, to be sure. He
would tell Minna, quite as a matter of fact, for
there could be no mistake. Hank Judge, the
machine agent, and Eli Stevens, the proprietor
of the corner store, had said only yesterday
there was to be a bank. Looking up the street
the little man spied a familiar figure, and
sprang to his feet as though released by a
spring, his hand already in the air. There was
Hank Judge, now, and he didn&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner, Hans,&#8221; announced Minna at his
elbow.</p>
<p>Holding the child of his brain hard in both
hands lest it should escape prematurely, the
little German went inside to preside over a repast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the distinctively German incense of which
ascended most appetizingly.</p>
<p>Hans, junior, in a childish treble, spoke
an honest little German blessing, beginning
&#8220;<i>Mein Vater von Himmel</i>,&#8221; and emphasized by
the raps of Hans senior&#8217;s knuckles on certain
other small heads to keep their owners quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fresh lettuce and radishes!&#8221; commented
Camilla, joyously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raised in our own garden <i>hinein</i>,&#8221; bobbed
Minna, in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And sauerkraut&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Ichabod.</p>
<p>&#8220;From cabbages so large,&#8221; completed Hans,
spreading his arms to designate an imaginary
vegetable of heroic proportions.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have grown very fast to be so
large in May,&#8221; commented Camilla.</p>
<p>Hans and Minna exchanged glances&ndash;&ndash;pitying,
superior glances&ndash;&ndash;such as we give behind
the backs of the infirm, or the very old; and the
subject of vegetables dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;A great country for a bank, this,&#8221; commented
Mr. Becher, with infinite <i>finesse</i> and
between intermittent puffs at a hot potato.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Hans nodded violent confirmation, then
words, English words, being valuable to him,
he came quickly to the test.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will build for the bank yourself, is it
not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not the German and Minna who exchanged
glances this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shall not build for the bank myself,
Mr. Becher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will rent, perhaps?&#8221; Hans&#8217;s faith
was beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shall not rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The German&#8217;s face fell. To have wasted all
that thought; for after all it was not the banker!</p>
<p>Minna, senior, stared in surprise, and her attention
being diverted, Minna the younger
seized the opportunity to inundate herself with
a cup of hot coffee.</p>
<p>The spell was broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a homestead,&#8221; explained
Ichabod.</p>
<p>Hans&#8217;s fork paused in mid-air and his mouth
forgot to close. At the point where the German
struck, the earth was very hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; he interrogated, weakly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>At this juncture the difference between the
two Minnas, which had been transferred from
the table to the kitchen, was resumed; and although
Ichabod ate the remaining kraut to the
last shred, and Camilla talked to Hans of the
<i>Vaterland</i> in his native German, each knew
the occasion was a failure. An ideal had been
raised, the ideal of a Napoleon of finance, a
banker; and that ideal materializing, lo there
stood forth a farmer! <i>Ach Gott von Himmel!</i></p>
<p>After dinner Hans stood in the doorway and
pointed out the land-office. Ichabod thanked
him, and under the impulse of habit felt in his
pocket for a cigar. None was there, and all at
once he remembered Ichabod Maurice did not
smoke. Strange he should have such an abominable
inclination to do so just then; but nevertheless
the fact remained. Ichabod Maurice
never had smoked.</p>
<p>He started up the street.</p>
<p>A small man, with very high boots and a very
long moustache, sat tipped back in the sun in
front of the land-office. He was telling a story;
a good one, judging from the attention of the
row of listeners. He grasped the chair tightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
with his left hand while his right, holding a cob
pipe, gesticulated actively. The story halted
abruptly as Ichabod came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy!&#8221; greeted the little man.</p>
<p>Maurice nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me interrupt you,&#8221; he temporized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; courtesied the teller of stories,
as he led the way inside. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told that one
until I&#8217;m tired of it, anyway.&#8221; He tapped the
ashes from his pipe-bowl, meditatively. &#8220;A
fellow has to kill the time some way, though,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; acquiesced Ichabod.</p>
<p>The agent took a chair behind the battered
pine desk, and pointed to another opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way I can help you?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Maurice. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking
of taking a homestead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent looked his visitor up and down and
back again; then, being native born, his surprise
broke forth in idiom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m jiggered!&#8221; he avowed.</p>
<p>It was Ichabod&#8217;s turn to make observation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you; you look it,&#8221; he corroborated
at length.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Again the little man stared; and in the silence
following, a hungry-looking bird-dog thrust his
thin muzzle in at the door, and sniffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; shouted the owner at the intruder,
adding in extenuation: &#8220;I&#8217;m busy.&#8221; He certainly
was &#8220;jiggered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I called to learn how one goes at it to take
a claim,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The <i>modus operandi</i>
isn&#8217;t exactly clear in my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent braced up in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s none of my business,&#8221;
he commented, &#8220;but as a speculation
you&#8217;d do a lot better to buy up the claims of
poor cusses who have to relinquish, than to
settle yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not speculating. I expect to build a
house, and live here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a friend, then, let me tell you you&#8217;ll
never stand it.&#8221; A stubby thumb made motion
up the narrow street. &#8220;You see this town. I
won&#8217;t say what it is&ndash;&ndash;you realize for yourself;
but bad as it is, it&#8217;s advanced civilization alongside
of the country. You&#8217;ll have to go ten miles
out to get any land that&#8217;s not taken.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
stopped and lit his pipe. &#8220;Do you know what
it means to live alone ten miles out on the
prairie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never lived in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, then, what it means.&#8221; He put
down his pipe and looked out at the open door.
His face changed; became softer, milder,
younger. His voice, when he spoke, added to
the impression of reminiscence, bearing an almost
forgotten tone of years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prairie!&#8221; he apostrophized. &#8220;It
means the loneliest place on God&#8217;s earth. It
means that living there, in life you bury yourself,
your hopes, your ambitions. It means you
work ever to forget the past&ndash;&ndash;and fail. It
means self, always; morning, noon, night; until
the very solitude becomes an incubus. It means
that in time you die, or, from being a man, become
as the cattle.&#8221; The speaker turned for
the first time to the tall man before him, his big
blue eyes wide open and round, his voice an
entreaty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move into it, man. It&#8217;s death and
worse than death to such as you! You&#8217;re too
old to begin. One must be born to the life;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
must never have known another. Don&#8217;t do it,
I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod Maurice, listening, read in that appeal,
beneath the words, the wild, unsatisfied
tale of a disappointed human life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are dissatisfied, lonesome&ndash;&ndash;There
was a time years ago perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; The glow had passed and
the face was old again, and heavy. &#8220;I remember
nothing. I&#8217;m dead, dead.&#8221; He drew a
rough map from his pocket and spread it out
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll move close, please, I&#8217;ll show you
the open lands.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an hour he explained homesteads, preemptions
and tree claims, and the method of
filing and proving up. At parting, Ichabod
held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for your advice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The man behind the desk puffed stolidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t intend to follow it,&#8221; he completed.</p>
<p>Instinctively, metaphor sprang to the lips of
Ichabod Maurice.</p>
<p>&#8220;A small speck of circumstance, which is
near, obliterates much that is in the distance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
He turned toward the door. &#8220;I shall not be
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little agent smoked on in silence for
some minutes, gazing motionless at the doorway
through which Ichabod had passed out.
Again the lean bird-dog thrust in an apologetic
head, dutifully awaiting recognition. At length
the man shook his pipe clean, and leaned back
in soliloquy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, woman, human nature; habit, solitude,
the prairie.&#8221; He spoke each word slowly,
and with a shake of his head. &#8220;He&#8217;s mad, mad;
but I pity him&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a pause&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;for I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog whined an interruption from the
doorway, and the man looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, boy,&#8221; he said, in recognition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter III&ndash;&ndash;The Wonder of Prairie</span></h3>
<p>Ichabod and Camilla selected their
claim together. A fair day&#8217;s drive it was
from the little town; a half-mile from the
nearest neighbor, a Norwegian, without two-score
English words in his vocabulary. Level
it was, as the surface of a lake or the plane of
a railroad bed.</p>
<p>Together, too, they chose the spot for their
home. Camilla sobbed over the word; but she
was soon dry-eyed and smiling again. Afterwards,
side by side, they did much journeying
to and from the nearest sawmill&ndash;&ndash;each trip
through a day and a night&ndash;&ndash;thirty odd miles
away. The mill was a small, primitive affair,
almost lost in the straggling box-elders and soft
maples that bordered the muddy Missouri, producing,
amid noisy protestations, the most despisable
of all lumber on the face of the globe&ndash;&ndash;twisting,
creeping, crawling cottonwood.</p>
<p>Having the material on the spot, Ichabod
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
built the house himself, after a plan never before
seen of man; joint product of his and
Camilla&#8217;s brains. It took a month to complete;
and in the meantime, each night they threw
their tired bodies on the brown earth, indifferent
to the thin canvas, which alone was spread
between them and the stars.</p>
<p>Too utterly weary for immediate sleep, they
listened to the sounds of animal life&ndash;&ndash;wholly
unfamiliar to ears urban trained&ndash;&ndash;as they stood
out distinct by contrast with a silence otherwise
absolute as the grave.</p>
<p>... The sharp bark of the coyote, near or
far away; soft as an echo, the gently cadenced
tremolo of the prairie owl. To these, the mere
opening numbers of the nightly concerts, the
two exotics would listen wonderingly; then, of a
sudden, typical, indescribable, lonely as death,
there would boom the cry which, as often
as it was repeated, recalled to Ichabod&#8217;s mind
the words of the little man in the land-office,
&#8220;loneliest sound on earth&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the sound which,
once heard, remains forever vivid&ndash;&ndash;the night
call of the prairie rooster. Even now, new and
fascinating as it all was, at the last wailing cry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
the two occupants of the tent would reach out
in the darkness until their hands met. Not till
then would they sleep.</p>
<p>In May, they finished and moved their few
belongings into the odd little two-room house.
True to instinct, Ichabod had built a fireplace,
though looking in any direction until the earth
met the sky, not a tree was visible; and Camilla
had added a cozy reading corner, which soon
developed into a sleeping corner,&ndash;&ndash;out-of-door
occupations in sun and wind being insurmountable
obstacles to mental effort.</p>
<p>But what matter! One straggling little folio,
the local newspaper, made its way into the
corner each week&ndash;&ndash;and that was all. They had
cut themselves off from the world, deliberately,
irrevocably. It was but natural that they
should sleep. All dead things sleep!</p>
<p>Month after month slipped by, and the first
ripple of local excitement and curiosity born of
their advent subsided. Ichabod knew nothing
of farming, but to learn was simple. It needed
only that he watch what his neighbors were
doing, and proceed to do likewise. He learned
soon to hold a breaking-plough in the tough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
prairie sod, and to swear mightily when it
balked at an unusually tough root. As well,
he came to know the oily feel of flax as he scattered
it by hand over the brown breaking. Later
he learned the smell of buckwheat blossoms, and
the delicate green coloring of sod corn, greener
by contrast with its dark background.</p>
<p>Nor was Camilla idle. The dresses she had
brought with her, dainty creations of foreign
make, soon gave way to domestic productions
of gingham and print. In these, the long brown
hands neatly gloved, she struggled with a tiny
garden, becoming in ratio as passed the weeks,
warmer, browner, and healthier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you happy?&#8221; asked Ichabod, one day,
observing her thus amid the fruits of her hands.</p>
<p>Camilla hesitated. Catching her hand,
Ichabod lifted her chin so that their eyes met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, are you happy?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>Another pause, though her eyes did not
falter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happier than I ever thought to be.&#8221; She
touched his sleeve tenderly. &#8220;But not completely
so, for&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she was not looking at him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
now,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;for I love you, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m a
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>They said no more; and though Ichabod went
back to his team, it was not to work. For many
minutes he stood motionless, a new problem of
right and wrong throbbing in his brain.</p>
<p>Fall came slowly, bringing the drowsy, hazy
days of so-called Indian Summer. It was the
season of threshing, and all day long to the
drowse of the air was added, near and afar, all-pervading
through the stillness, the sleepy hum
of the separator. Typical voice of the prairie
was that busy drone, penetrating to the ears as
the ubiquitous odor of the buffalo grass to the
nostril, again bearing resemblance in that, once
heard, memory would reproduce the sound
until recollection was no more.</p>
<p>Winter followed, and they, who had thought
the earth quiet before, found it still now indeed.
Even the voice of the prairie-chicken was
hushed; only the sharp knife-like cutting of
spread wings told of a flock&#8217;s passage at night.
The level country, mottled white with occasional
drifts, and brown from spots blown bare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
by the wind, stretched out seemingly interminable,
until the line of earth and sky met.</p>
<p>Idle perforce, the two exotics would stand for
hours in the sunshine of their open doorway,
shading their eyes from the glare and looking
out, out into the distance that was as yet only a
name&ndash;&ndash;and that the borrowed name of an
Indian tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a country!&#8221; Camilla would say,
struck each time anew with a never-ending
wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what a country,&#8221; Ichabod would echo,
unconscious that he had repeated the same
words in the same way a score of times before.</p>
<p>In January, a blizzard settled upon them, and
for two days and nights they took turns keeping
the big kitchen stove red hot. The West knows
no such storms, now. Man has not only changed
the face of the earth, but, in so doing, has annihilated
that terror of the past&ndash;&ndash;the Dakota
blizzard.</p>
<p>In those days, though, it was very real, as
Ichabod learned. He had prepared for winter,
by hauling a huge pile of cordwood and stacking
it, as a protection to windward, the full length
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
of the little cabin, thinking the spot always accessible;
but he had builded in ignorance.</p>
<p>The snow first commenced falling in the
afternoon. By the next morning the tiny house
was buried to the window sashes. Looking out,
there could be seen but an indistinct slanting
white wall, scarcely ten feet away: a screen
through which the sunlight filtered dimly, like
the solemn haze of a church. The earth was not
silent, now. The falling of the sleet and snow
was as the striking of fine shot, and the sound
of the wind a steady unceasing moan, resembling
the sigh of a big dynamo at a distance.</p>
<p>Slowly, inch by inch, during that day the
snow crept up the window panes until, before
the coming of darkness without, it fell within.
Banked though they were on three sides, on the
fourth side, unprotected, the cold penetrated
bitterly,&ndash;&ndash;a cold no living thing could withstand
without shelter. Then it was that
Ichabod and Camilla feared to sleep, and
that the long vigil began.</p>
<p>By the next morning there was no light from
the windows. The snow had drifted level with
the eaves. Ichabod stood in the narrow window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
frame, and, lowering the glass from the top,
beat a hole upward with a pole to admit air.
Through the tunnel thus formed there filtered
the dull gray light of day: and at its end, obstructing,
there stood revealed a slanting drab
wall,&ndash;&ndash;a condensed milky way.</p>
<p>The storm was yet on, and he closed the
window. To get outside for fuel that day was
impossible, so with an axe Ichabod chopped a
hole through the wall into the big pile, and on
wood thus secured sawed steadily in the tiny
kitchen, while the kerosene lamp at his side
sputtered, and the fire crackled in a silence, like
that surrounding a hunted animal in its den.</p>
<p>Many usual events had occurred in the lives
of the wandering Ichabod and Camilla, which
had been forgotten; but the memory of that
day, the overwhelming, incontestible knowledge
of the impotency of wee, restless, inconsequent
man, they were never to forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiny, tiny, mortal!&#8221; laughed the storm.
&#8220;To think you would combat Nature, would
defy her, the power of which I am but one of
many, many manifestations!&#8221; And it laughed
again. The two prisoners, listening, their ears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
to the tunnel, heard the sound, and felt to the
full its biting mockery.</p>
<p>Next day the siege was raised, and the sun
smiled as only the sun can smile upon miles and
miles of dazzling snow crystals. Ichabod
climbed out&ndash;&ndash;by way of the window route&ndash;&ndash;and
worked for hours with a shovel before he
had a channel from the tiny, submerged shanty
to the light of day beyond. Then together he
and Camilla stood side by side in the doorway,
as they had done so many times before, looking
about them at the boundless prairie, drifted in
waves of snow like the sea: the wonder of it all,
ever new, creeping over them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a country!&#8221; voiced Camilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a country, indeed,&#8221; echoed Ichabod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lonely and mysterious as Death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as Death or&ndash;&ndash;Life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter IV&ndash;&ndash;A Revelation</span></h3>
<p>Time, unchanging automaton, moved on
until late spring. Paradox of nature, the
warm brown tints of chilly days gave place
under the heat of slanting suns to the cool green
of summer. All at once, sudden as though
autochthonal, there appeared meadow-larks and
blackbirds: dead weeds or man-erected posts
serving in lieu of trees as vantage points from
which to sing. Ground squirrels whistled cheerily
from newly broken fields and roadways.
Coveys of quail, tame as barn-yard fowls,
played about the beaten paths, and ran pattering
in the dust ahead of each passing team.
Again, from its winter&#8217;s rest, lonely, uncertain
as to distance, came the low, booming call of the
prairie rooster. Nature had awakened, and the
joy of that awakening was upon the land.</p>
<p>Of a morning in May the faded, dust-covered
day-coach drew in at the tiny prairie village. A
little man alighted. He stood a moment on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
platform, his hands deep in his pockets, a big
black cigar between his teeth, and looked out
over the town. The coloring of the short straggling
street was more weather-stained than
a year ago, yet still very new, and the newcomer
smiled as he looked; a big broad smile that
played about his lips, turning up the corners of
his brown moustache, showing a flash of white
teeth, and lighting a pair of big blue eyes which
lay, like a woman&#8217;s, beneath heavy lashes. In
youth, that smile would have been a grin; but
it was no grin now. The man was far from
youth, and about the mouth and eyes were deep
lines, which told of one who knew of the world.</p>
<p>Slowly the smile disappeared, and as it faded
the little man puffed harder at the cigar. Evidently
something he particularly wished to
explain would not become clear to his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all places,&#8221; he soliloquized, &#8220;to have
chosen&ndash;&ndash;this!&#8221;</p>
<p>He started up the street, over the irregular
warping sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotel, sir-r?&#8221; The formula was American,
the trilling r&#8217;s distinctly German.</p>
<p>The traveller turned at the sound, to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
acquaintance with Hans Becher; for it was
Hans Becher, very much metamorphosed from
the retiring German of a year ago. He made
the train regularly now.</p>
<p>The small man nodded and held out his grip;
together they walked up the street. In front
of the hotel they stopped, and the stranger
pulled out his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a livery here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; at the street end&ndash;&ndash;the side to the left
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll be back with you this
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans Becher stared, open-mouthed, as the
man moved off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not to dinner return?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man stopped, and smiled without
apparent reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Keep the grip. I expect to lunch,&#8221;
again he smiled without provocation, &#8220;elsewhere.
By the way,&#8221; he added, as an afterthought,
&#8220;can you tell me where Mr. Maurice&ndash;&ndash;Ichabod
Maurice&ndash;&ndash;lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>The German nodded violent confirmation of
a direction indicated by his free hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Straight out, eight miles. Little house with
<i>paint</i>&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;strong emphasis on the last&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>white</i>
paint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans saw the escape of an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are friends of yours, perhaps?&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
grasped at it.</p>
<p>The little man did not turn, but the smile that
seemed almost a habit, sprang to his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;friends of mine,&#8221; he corroborated.</p>
<p>Hans, personification of knowledge, stood
bobbing on the doorstep, until the trail of smoke
vanished from sight, then brought the satchel
inside and set it down hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her brother has come,&#8221; he announced to
the wide-eyed Minna.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Wessen Bruder?</i>&#8221; Minna was obviously
excited, as attested by the lapse from English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we not now Americans naturalized?&#8221;
rebuked Hans, icily. Suddenly he thawed.
&#8220;Whose brother! The brother of Camilla
Maurice, to be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minna scrutinized the bag, curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did he so&ndash;&ndash;inform you?&#8221; she questioned
unadvisedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not necessary. I have eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offended masculine dignity clumped noisily
toward the door; instinctive feminine diplomacy
sprang to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so wise, Hans!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Peace, sweet Peace, returned to the
household of Becher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the little man had secured a
buggy, and was jogging out into the country.
He drove very leisurely, looking about him curiously.
Of a sudden he threw down his cigar,
and sniffed at the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buffalo grass, I&#8217;ll wager! I&#8217;ve heard of
it,&#8221; and in the instinctive action of every newcomer
he sniffed again.</p>
<p>Camilla Maurice sat in front of her tiny
house, the late morning sun warm about her;
one hand supported a book, slanted carefully to
avoid the light, the other held the crank of a
barrel-churn. As she read, she turned steadily,
the monotonous <i>chug!</i> <i>chug!</i> of the tumbling
cream drowning all other sounds.</p>
<p>Suddenly the shadow of a horse passed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and a rough livery buggy stopped at her side.
She looked up. Instinctively her hand dropped
the crank, and her face turned white; then
equally involuntarily she returned to her work,
and the <i>chug!</i> <i>chug!</i> continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Ichabod Maurice,&#8221; drawling emphasis
on the name, &#8220;live here?&#8221; asked a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does.&#8221; Camilla&#8217;s chin was trembling;
her answer halted abruptly.</p>
<p>The man looked down at her, genuine amusement
depicted upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please stop your work for a
moment, Camilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>With the name, one hand made swift movement
of deprecation. &#8220;Pardon if I mistake,
but I take it you&#8217;re Camilla Maurice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m Camilla Maurice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so! You see, Ichabod and I were old
chums together in college&ndash;&ndash;all that sort of
thing; consequently I&#8217;ve always wanted to
meet&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman stood up. Her face still was
very white, but her chin did not tremble now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stop this farce,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;What
is it you wish?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>The man in the buggy again made a motion
of deprecation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just about to say, that happening to
be in town, and incidentally hearing the name,
I wondered if it were possible.... But,
pardon, I haven&#8217;t introduced myself. Allow
me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; and he bowed elaborately. &#8220;Arnold,
Asa Arnold.... You&#8217;ve heard Ichabod
mention my name, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman held up her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again I ask, what do you wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you insist, first of all I&#8217;d like to
speak a moment with Ichabod.&#8221; His face
changed suddenly. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake,
Eleanor, if he must alter his name, why did he
choose such a barbaric substitute as Ichabod?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were he here&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;evenly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;he&#8217;d doubtless
explain that himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not here, then?&#8221; No banter in the
voice now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never fear&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;quickly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;he&#8217;ll return.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment they looked into each other&#8217;s eyes;
challengingly, as they had looked unnumbered
times before.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you suggest, Eleanor,&#8221; said the man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
slowly, &#8220;this farce has gone far enough. Where
may I tie this horse? I wish to speak with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla pointed to a post, and silently went
toward the house. Soon the man followed her,
stopping a moment to take a final puff at his
cigar before throwing it away.</p>
<p>Within the tiny kitchen they sat opposite,
a narrow band of warm spring sunshine creeping
in at the open door separating them. The
woman looked out over the broad prairie, her
color a trifle higher than usual, the lids of her
eyes a shade nearer together&ndash;&ndash;that was all.
The man crossed his legs and waited, looking so
small that he seemed almost boyish. In the silence,
the drone of feeding poultry came from
the back-yard, and the sleepy breathing of the
big collie on the steps sounded plainly through
the room.</p>
<p>A minute passed. Neither spoke. Then,
with a shade of annoyance, the man shifted in
his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, perhaps, you&#8217;d have something
you wished to say. If not, however&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
paused meaningly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said a moment ago, you wished to
speak to <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As usual, you make everything as difficult
as possible.&#8221; The shade of annoyance became
positive. &#8220;Such being the case, we may as well
come to the point. How soon do you contemplate
bringing this&ndash;&ndash;this incident to a close?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer to that question concerns me
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>An ordinary man would have laughed; but
Asa Arnold was not an ordinary man&ndash;&ndash;not at
this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As your husband, I can&#8217;t agree with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla Maurice took up his words, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mistake. You&#8217;re the husband of
Eleanor Owen. I&#8217;m not she.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man went on calmly, as though there had
been no interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be hard on you, Eleanor.
I don&#8217;t think I have been hard on you. A year
has passed, and I&#8217;ve known you were here from
the first day. But this sort of thing can&#8217;t go
on indefinitely; there&#8217;s a limit, even to good
nature. I ask you again, when are you coming
back?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>The woman looked at her companion, for the
first time steadily. Even she, who knew him so
well, felt a shade of wonder at the man who
could adjust all the affairs of his life in the
same voice with which he ordered his dinner.
Before, she had always thought this attitude of
his pure affectation. Now she knew better,
knew it mirrored the man himself. He had
done this thing. Knowing her whereabouts all
the time, he had allotted her the past year, as an
employer would grant a holiday to an assistant.
Now he asked her to return to the old life, as
calmly as one returns in the fall to the city home
after an outing! Only one man in the world
could have done that thing, and that man
was before her&ndash;&ndash;her husband by law&ndash;&ndash;Asa
Arnold!</p>
<p>The wonder of it all crept into her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming back, can&#8217;t you understand?
I&#8217;m never coming back,&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>The man arose and stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; he said very quietly. &#8220;Not
yet. I won&#8217;t begin, now, after all these years
to make protestations of love. The thing
called Love we&#8217;ve discussed too often already,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and without result. Anyway, that&#8217;s not the
point. We never pretended to be lovers, even
when we were married. We were simply useful,
very useful to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla started to interrupt him, but, preventing,
he held up his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We talked over a certain possibility&ndash;&ndash;one
now a reality&ndash;&ndash;before we were married.&#8221; He
caught the look upon her face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t say it
was ideal. It simply <i>was</i>,&#8221; he digressed slowly
in answer, then hurried on: &#8220;That was only
five years ago, Eleanor, and we were far from
young.&#8221; He looked at her, searchingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve not forgotten the contract we drew
up, that stood above the marriage obligation,
above everything, supreme law for you and
me?&#8221; Instinctively his hand went to an inner
pocket, where the rustle of a paper answered
his touch. &#8220;Remember; it&#8217;s not a favor I ask of
you, but the fulfilment of your own word.
Think a moment before you say you&#8217;ll never
return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla Maurice found an answer very
difficult. Had he been angry, or abusive, it
would have been easy; but as it was&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You overlook the fact of change. A lifetime
isn&#8217;t required for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I overlook nothing.&#8221; The man went back
to his chair. &#8220;You remember, as well as I, that
we considered the problem of change&ndash;&ndash;and
laughed at it. I repeat, we&#8217;re no longer in
swaddling clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be that as it may, I tell you the whole
world looks different to me now.&#8221; The speaker
struggled bravely, but the ghastliness of such a
discussion wore on her nerves, and her face
twitched. &#8220;No power on earth could make me
keep that contract since I&#8217;ve changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suggestion of a smile played about the
man&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve succeeded, perhaps, in finding that
for which we searched so long in vain, an
&aelig;sthetic, non-corporeal love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to answer a question which was
intended as an insult.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words out of her mouth, the woman
regretted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though quick yourself to take offence, you
seem at no great pains to avoid giving affront
to another.&#8221; The man voiced the reprimand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
without the twitch of an eyelid, and finished
with another question: &#8220;Have you any reason
for doing as you&#8217;ve done, other than the one
you gave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reason! Reason!&#8221; Camilla Maurice stared
again. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it reason enough that I love him,
and don&#8217;t love you? Isn&#8217;t it sufficient reason
to one who has lived until middle life in darkness
that a ray of light is in sight? Of all
people in the world, you&#8217;re the one who should
understand the reason best!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would any of those arguments be sufficient
to break another contract?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but one I didn&#8217;t mention would. Even
when I lived with you, I was of no more importance
than a half-dozen other women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t protest at time of the agreement.
You knew then my belief and,&#8221; Arnold
paused meaningly, &#8220;your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>A memory of the past came to the woman;
the dark, lonely past, which, even yet, after so
many years, came to her like a nightmare; the
time when she was a stranger in a strange town,
without joy of past or hope of future; most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
lonely being on God&#8217;s earth, a woman with an
ambition&ndash;&ndash;and without friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was mad&ndash;&ndash;I see it now&ndash;&ndash;lonely mad. I
met you. Our work was alike, and we were
very useful to each other.&#8221; One white hand
made motion of repugnance at the thought. &#8220;I
was mad, I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your excuse for ignoring a solemn
obligation?&#8221; Arnold looked her through. &#8220;Is
that your excuse for leaving me for another,
without a word of explanation, or even the conventional
form of a divorce?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just that explanation&ndash;&ndash;this&ndash;&ndash;I
wished to avoid. It&#8217;s hard for us both, and
useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Useless!&#8221; The man quickly picked up the
word. &#8220;Useless! I don&#8217;t like the suggestion
of that word. It hints of death, and old age,
and hateful things. It has no place with the
living.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a paper from his pocket, slowly, and
spread it on his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me for again recalling past history,
Eleanor; but to use a word that is dead!...
You must have forgotten&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The writing, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
dainty, feminine hand, was turned toward her,
tauntingly, compellingly.</p>
<p>The man waited for some response; but
Camilla Maurice was silent. That bit of paper,
the shadow of a seemingly impossible past,
made her, for the time, question her identity,
almost doubt it.</p>
<p>Five years ago, almost to the day, high up
in a city building, in a dainty little room, half
office, half <i>atelier</i>, a man and a woman had
copied an agreement, each for the other, and
had sworn an oath ever to remain true to that
solemn bond.... She had brought nothing
to him, but herself; not even affection. He,
on the other hand, had saved her from a life of
drudgery by elevating her to a position where,
free of the necessity of struggling for a bare
existence, she might hope to consummate the
fruition of at least a part of her dreams. On
her part....</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Witnesseth: The said Eleanor Owen is at
liberty to follow her own inclinations as she may
see fit; she is to remain free of any and all responsibilities
and restrictions such as customarily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
attach to the supervision of a household,
excepting as she may elect to exercise her wifely
prerogatives; being absolutely free to pursue
whatsoever occupation or devices she may desire
or choose, the same as if she were yet a
spinster....</i></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>In Consideration of Which: The said Eleanor
Owen agrees never so to comport herself
that by word or conduct will she bring ridicule....
dishonor upon the name....</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Recollection of it all came to her with a rush;
but the words ran together and swam in a maddening
blur&ndash;&ndash;the roar from the street below,
dull with distance; the hum of the big building,
with its faint concussions of closing doors; the
air from the open window, not like the sweet
prairie air of to-day, but heavy, smoky, typical
breath of the town, yet pregnant with the indescribable
throb of spring, impossible to efface
or to disguise! The compelling intimacy and
irrevocability of that memory overwhelmed her,
now; a dark, evil flood that blotted out the sunshine
of the present.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>The paper rustled, as the man smoothed it
flat with his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I read?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face stood clear&ndash;&ndash;cruelly clear&ndash;&ndash;in
the sunlight; about her mouth and eyes
there was an expression which, from repetition,
we have learned to associate with the circle surrounding
a new-made grave: an expression
hopelessly desperate, desperately hopeless.</p>
<p>Of a sudden her chin trembled and her face
dropped into her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read, if you wish&#8221;; and the smooth brown
head, with its thread of gray, trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor!&#8221; with a sudden vibration of tenderness
in his voice. &#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>But the woman made no response.</p>
<p>The man had taken a step forward; now he
sat down again, looking through the open doorway
at the stretch of green prairie, with the
road, a narrow ribbon of brown, dividing it fair
in the middle. In the distance a farmer&#8217;s
wagon was rumbling toward town, a trail of
fine dust, like smoke, suspended in the air
behind. It rattled past, and the big collie on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the step woke to give furious chase in its wake,
then returned slowly, a little conscious under the
stranger&#8217;s eye, to sleep as before. Asa Arnold
sat through it all, still as one devitalized; an
expression on his face no man had ever seen
before; one hopeless, lonely, akin to that of the
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read, if you wish,&#8221; repeated Camilla,
bitterly.</p>
<p>For a long minute her companion made no
motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unnecessary,&#8221; he intoned at last. &#8220;You
know as well as I that neither of us will ever
forget one word it contains.&#8221; He hesitated and
his voice grew gentle. &#8220;Eleanor, you know I
didn&#8217;t come here to insult you, or to hurt you
needlessly;&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m human. You seem to
forget this. You brand me less than a man, and
then ask of me the unselfishness of a God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla&#8217;s white face lifted from her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask nothing except that you leave me
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time the little man showed his
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last you mention the point I came here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
to arrange. Were you alone, rest assured I
shouldn&#8217;t trouble you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just this. I wouldn&#8217;t be human if I
did what you ask&ndash;&ndash;if I condoned what you&#8217;ve
done and are still doing.&#8221; He was fairly started
now, and words came crowding each other; reproachful,
tempestuous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever stop to think of the past&ndash;&ndash;think
what you&#8217;ve done, Eleanor?&#8221; He
paused without giving her an opportunity to
answer. &#8220;Let me tell you, then. You&#8217;ve
broken every manner of faith between man and
woman. If you believe in God, you&#8217;ve broken
faith with Him as well. Don&#8217;t think for a
moment I ever had respect for marriage as a
divine institution, but I did have respect for
you, and at your wish we conformed. You&#8217;re
my wife now, by your own choosing. Don&#8217;t
interrupt me, please. I repeat, God has no
more to do with ceremonial marriage now than
he had at the time of the Old Testament and
polygamy. It&#8217;s a man-made bond, but an
obligation nevertheless, and as such, at the
foundation of all good faith between man and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
woman. It&#8217;s this good faith you&#8217;ve broken.&#8221;
A look of bitterness flashed over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I could excuse this and release you at
the asking, remaining your friend, your best
friend as before; but to be thrown aside without
even a &#8216;by your leave,&#8217; and that for another
man&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He hesitated and finished slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know me well enough, Eleanor, to
realize that I&#8217;m in earnest when I say that while
I live the man has yet to be born who can take
something of mine away from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camilla gestured passionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words: while growling hard at the
dog who approached your bone, you have no
hesitation in stealing from another!&#8221; The accumulated
bitterness of years of repression
spoke in the taunt.</p>
<p>Across the little man&#8217;s face there fell an impenetrable
mask, like the armor which dropped
about an ancient ship of war before the shock
of battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not on trial. I&#8217;ve not changed my
name&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he nodded significantly toward the
view beyond the open door,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and sought seclusion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Again the bitterness of memory prompted
Camilla to speak the harshest words of her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you hadn&#8217;t the decency. It was more
pleasure to thrust your shame daily in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arnold&#8217;s color paled above the dark beard
line; but the woman took no heed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you wait a year,&#8221; continued the
bitter voice, &#8220;to end in&ndash;&ndash;this? If it must
have been&ndash;&ndash;why not before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat, I&#8217;m not on trial. If you&#8217;ve anything
to say, I&#8217;ll listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something new in the man&#8217;s face caught Camilla&#8217;s
attention, softened the tone of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only this to say. You&#8217;ve asked for an
explanation and a promise; but I can give you
neither. If there ever comes a time when I feel
they&#8217;re due you, and I&#8217;m able to comply, I&#8217;ll
give them both gladly.&#8221; The absent look of the
past returned to her eyes. &#8220;Even if I wished,
I couldn&#8217;t give you an explanation now. I can&#8217;t
make myself understand the contradiction.
Somehow, knowing you so long, your beliefs
crept insistently into my loneliness. It seems
hideous now, but I was honest then. I believed
them, too. I don&#8217;t blame you; I only pity you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
You were the embodiment of protest against the
established, of the non-responsibility of the individual,
of skepticism in everything. Your eternal
&#8216;why&#8217; covered my horizon. Every familiar
thing came to bear a question I couldn&#8217;t answer.
My whole life seemed one eternal doubt. One
thing I&#8217;d never known, and I questioned it most
of all; the one thing I know now to be the truth,&ndash;&ndash;the
greatest truth in the world.&#8221; For an instant
the present crowded the past from Camilla&#8217;s
mind, but only for an instant. &#8220;Whatever I
was at the time, you&#8217;d made me&ndash;&ndash;with your
deathless &#8216;why.&#8217; When I signed the obligation
of that day, I believed it was of my own free
will; but I know now it was you who wrote it
for both of us&ndash;&ndash;you, with your perpetual interrogation.
I don&#8217;t accuse you of doing this
deliberately, maliciously. We were both deceived;
but none the less the fact remains.&#8221; A
shadow, almost of horror, passed over her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time passed, and though you didn&#8217;t know,
I was in Hell. Reason told me I was right. Instinct,
something, called me a drag. I tried to
compromise, and we were married. Then, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the first time, came realization. We were the
best of friends,&ndash;&ndash;but only friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder how I knew. I didn&#8217;t tell you
then. I couldn&#8217;t. I could only feel, and that
not clearly. The shadow of your &#8216;why&#8217; was
still dark upon me. What I vaguely felt then,
though, I know now; as I recognize light or cold
or pain.&#8221; Her voice assumed the tone of one who
speaks of mysteries; slow, vibrant. &#8220;In every
woman&#8217;s mind the maternal instinct should be
uppermost; before everything, before God,&ndash;&ndash;unashamed,
inevitable. It&#8217;s unmistakably the
distinction of a good woman from a bad. The
choosing of the father of her child is a woman&#8217;s
unfailing test of love.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the man before her dropped into
his hands, but she did not notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gropingly I felt this, and the knowledge
came almost as an inspiration. It gave a clue
to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; The man&#8217;s eyes blazed, as he
leaped from his chair. &#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a step forward, his hand before him,
his face twitching uncontrollably. The collie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
on the step awoke, and seeing his mistress
threatened, growled ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, I tell you!&#8221; Arnold choked for
words. This the man of &#8220;why,&#8221; whom nothing
before could shake!</p>
<p>Camilla paled as her companion arose, and
the dog, bristling, came inside the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; blazed the man, with a threatening
step, and the collie fled.</p>
<p>The interruption loosed words which came
tumbling forth in a torrent, as Arnold returned
to face her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m human, and yet tell me that
to my face?&#8221; His voice was terrible. &#8220;You
women brand men cruel! No man on earth
would speak as you have spoken to a woman
he&#8217;d lived with for four years!&#8221; The sentences
crowded over each other, like water over a fall&ndash;&ndash;his
eyes flashing like a spray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you before, I&#8217;m not on trial; that it
was not my place to defend. I don&#8217;t do so now;
but since you&#8217;ve spoken, I&#8217;ll answer your question.
You ask why I didn&#8217;t come a year ago,
hinting that I wanted to be more cruel. God!
the blindness and injustice of you women! Because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
we men don&#8217;t show&ndash;&ndash;Bah!... I
was paying my own price. We weren&#8217;t living
by the marriage vow; it was but a farce. Our
own contract was the vital thing, and it had said&ndash;&ndash;But
I won&#8217;t repeat. God, it was bitter! But
I thought you&#8217;d come back. I loved you still.&#8221;
He paused for words, breathing hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say, I&#8217;ll never know what love is.
Blind! I&#8217;ve always loved you until this moment,
when you killed my love. You say I was
untrue. It&#8217;s false. I swear it before&ndash;&ndash;you, as
you were once,&ndash;&ndash;when you were my god. Had
you trusted me, as I trusted you, there&#8217;d have
been no thought of unfaithfulness in your
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman sank back in the chair, her face
covered, her whole body trembling; but Asa
Arnold went on like the storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was ever true to you. From the first
moment we met, and against my own beliefs.
You didn&#8217;t see. You expected me to protest it
daily: to repeat the tale as a child repeats its
lesson for a comfit. Blind, I say, blind! You&#8217;ll
charge that I never told you that I loved you.
You wouldn&#8217;t have believed me, even had I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
done so. Besides, I didn&#8217;t realize that you
doubted, until the time when you were learning&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
he walked jerkily across the room and
took up his hat,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;learning the thing you
threw in my face.&#8221; He started to leave, but
stopped in the doorway, without looking back.
&#8220;You tell me you&#8217;ve suffered. For the first
time in my life I say to another human being:
I hope so.&#8221; He turned, unsteadily, down the
steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; pleaded the woman. &#8220;Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man did not stop, or turn.</p>
<p>Camilla Maurice sank back in the chair, weak
as one sick unto death, her mind a throbbing,
whirling chaos,&ndash;&ndash;as of a patient under an
an&aelig;sthetic. Something she knew she ought to
do, intended doing, and could not. She groped
desperately, but overwhelming, insistent, there
had developed in her a sudden, preventing tumult&ndash;&ndash;in
paradox, a confusion in rhythm&ndash;&ndash;like
the beating of a great hammer on an anvil,
only incredibly more swift than blows from human
hands. Over and over again she repeated
to herself the one word: &#8220;wait,&#8221; &#8220;wait,&#8221;
&#8220;wait,&#8221; but mechanically now, without thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
as to the reason. Then, all at once, soft, all-enfolding,
kindly Nature wrapped her in
darkness.</p>
<p>She awoke with the big collie licking her
hand, and a numbness of cramped limbs that
was positive pain. A long-necked pullet was
standing in the doorway, with her mouth open;
others stood wondering, beyond. The sun had
moved until it no longer shone in at the tiny
south windows, and the shadow of the house had
begun to lengthen.</p>
<p>Camilla stood up in the doorway; uncertain,
dazed. A great lump was on her forehead,
which she stroked absently, without surprise at
its presence. She looked about the yard, and, her
breath coming more quickly, at the prairie. A
broad green plain, parted by the road squarely
in the centre, smiled at her in the sunlight.
That was all. She stepped outside and shaded
her eyes with her hand. Not a wagon nor a
human being was in sight.</p>
<p>Again the weakness and the blackness came
stealing over her; she sank down on the doorstep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;O God, what have I done!&#8221; she wailed.</p>
<p>The hens returned to their search for bugs;
but the big collie stayed by her side, whimpering
and fondling her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter V&ndash;&ndash;The Dominance of the Evolved</span></h3>
<p>The keen joy of life was warmly flooding
Ichabod Maurice this spring day. Not
life for the sake of an ambition or a duty, but
delight in the mere animal pleasure of existence.
He had risen early, and, a neighbor with him,
they had driven forth: stars all about, perpendicular,
horizontal, save in the reddening east,
upon their long day&#8217;s drive to the sawmill. The
two teams plodded along steadily, their footfall
muffled in the soft prairie loam; the earth elsewhere
soundless, with a silence which even yet
was a marvel to the city man.</p>
<p>The majesty of it held him silent until day
dawned, and with the coming of the sun there
woke in unison the chorus of joyous animal life.
Then Ichabod, his long legs dangling over the
dashboard, lifted up a voice untrained as the
note of a loon, and sang lustily, until his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
on the wagon ahead,&ndash;&ndash;boy-faced, man-bodied,&ndash;&ndash;grinned
perilously.</p>
<p>The long-visaged man was near happiness
that morning,&ndash;&ndash;unbelievably near. By nature
unsocial, by habit, city inbred, artificially taciturn,
there came with the primitive happiness of
the moment the concomitant primitive desire for
companionship. He smiled self-tolerantly
when, obeying an instinct, he wound the lines
around the seat, and went ahead to the man,
who grinned companionably as he made room
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s country, this.&#8221; Ichabod&#8217;s hand made
an all-including gesture, as he seated himself
comfortably, his hat low over his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; and the grin was repeated.</p>
<p>The tall man reflected. Sunburned, roughly
dressed, unshaven as he, Maurice, was, this boy-man
never failed the word of respect. Ichabod
examined him curiously out of his shaded lids.
Big brown hands; body strong as a bull; powerful
shoulders; neck turned like a model; a soft
chin under a soft, light beard; gentle blue eyes&ndash;&ndash;all
in all, a face so open that its very legibility
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
seemed a mark. It reddened now, under
the scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon,&#8221; said Ichabod. &#8220;I was thinking
how happy you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; And the face reddened again.</p>
<p>Ichabod smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;When is it to be, Ole?&#8221;</p>
<p>The big body wriggled in blissful embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the house is built,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;confusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re building very fast, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swede grinned confirmation. Words
were of value to Ole.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the question was superfluous,&#8221; and
Ichabod likewise smiled in genial comradery. A
moment later, however, the smile vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very content as it is, Ole,&#8221; he
digressed, equivocally; &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;supposing&ndash;&ndash;Minna
were already the wife of a friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swede stared in breathless astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t, though&#8221; he gasped at length in
startled protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But supposing&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be so. I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d do nothing?&#8221; rank anarchy in the
suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would there be to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod temporized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing again, she loved you, and didn&#8217;t
love her husband?&#8221; Ole scratched his head, seeing
very devious passages beyond. &#8220;That
would be different,&#8221; and he crossed his legs.</p>
<p>Ichabod smiled. The world over, human nature
is fashioned from one mould.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing, once more, it&#8217;s a year from now,&ndash;&ndash;five
years from now. You&#8217;ve married
Minna, but you&#8217;re not happy. She&#8217;s grown to
hate you,&ndash;&ndash;to love another man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ole&#8217;s faith was beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not to be thought of. It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But supposing,&#8221; urged Ichabod.</p>
<p>The boy-man was silent for a very long minute;
then his face darkened, and the soft jaw
grew hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he said slowly,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t
know, but I think I kill that man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod did not smile this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all much alike, Ole. I think you
would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>They drove on; far past the town, now; the
sun high in the sky; dew sparkling like prisms
innumerable; the prairie colorings soft as a
rug&ndash;&ndash;its varied greens of groundwork blending
with the narrow line of fresh breaking rolling
at their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were born in this country?&#8221; asked
Ichabod suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Iowa. It&#8217;s much like this&ndash;&ndash;only
rougher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll live here, always?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swede shook his head and the boy&#8217;s
face grew older.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; some day, we&#8217;re going to the city&ndash;&ndash;Minna
and I. We&#8217;ve planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod was thoughtful a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a friend of yours, Ole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very good friend,&#8221; repeated the mystified
Swede.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, listen, and don&#8217;t forget.&#8221; The voice
was vibrant, low, but the boy heard it clearly
above the noise of the wagon. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it,
Ole; in God&#8217;s name, don&#8217;t do it! Stay here,
you&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221; He looked the open-mouthed
listener deep in the eyes. &#8220;If you ever say a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
prayer, let it be the old one, even though it be an
insult to a just God:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Lead us not into temptation.&#8217;
Avoid, as you would avoid death, the
love of money, the fever of unrest, the desire to
become greater than your fellows, the thirst to
know and to taste all things, which is the spirit
of the city. Live close to Nature, where all is
equal and all is good; where sleep comes in the
time of sleep, and work when it is day. Do that
labor which comes to you at the moment, leaving
to-morrow to Nature.&#8221; He crossed his long legs,
and pressed his hat down over his eyes. &#8220;Accept
life as Nature gives it, day by day. Don&#8217;t
question, and you&#8217;ll find it good.&#8221; He repeated
himself slowly. &#8220;That&#8217;s the secret. Don&#8217;t
doubt, or question anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Swede&#8217;s throat there was a rattling,
which presaged speech, but it died away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love children, Ole?&#8221; asked Ichabod,
suddenly.</p>
<p>The boy face flushed. Ole was very young.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he lagged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do. Every living human being
does. It&#8217;s the one good instinct, which even
the lust of gain doesn&#8217;t down. It&#8217;s the tie that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
binds,&ndash;&ndash;the badge of brotherhood which makes
the world one.&#8221; He gently laid his hand on the
broad shoulder beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ashamed to say you love children,
boy, though the rest of the world laugh,&ndash;&ndash;for
they&#8217;re laughing at a lie. They&#8217;ll tell you the
parental instinct is dying out with the advance
of civilization; that the time will come when
man will educate himself to his own extinction.
It&#8217;s false, I tell you, absolutely false.&#8221; Ichabod
had forgotten himself, and he rushed on,
far above the head of the gaping Swede.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one instinct in the world, the instinct
of parenthood, which advances eternal,
stronger, infinitely, as man&#8217;s mind grows
stronger. So unvarying the rule that it&#8217;s almost
an index of civilization itself, advancing from
a crude instinct of the body-base and animal&ndash;&ndash;until
it reaches the realm of the mind: the highest,
the holiest of man&#8217;s desires: yet stronger immeasurably,
as with the educated, things of the
mind are stronger than things of the body.
Those who deny this are fools, or imposters,&ndash;&ndash;I
know not which. To do so is to strike at the
very foundation of human nature,&ndash;&ndash;but impotently,&ndash;&ndash;for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
in fundamentals, human nature
is good.&#8221; Unconsciously, a smile flashed over
the long face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about depopulating the earth! All
the wars of primitive man were inadequate. The
vices of civilization have likewise failed. Even
man&#8217;s mightiest weapon, legislation, couldn&#8217;t
stay the tide for a moment, if it would. While
man is man, and woman is woman, that long,
above government, religion,&ndash;&ndash;life and death
itself,&ndash;&ndash;will reign supreme the eternal instinct
of parenthood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod caught himself in his own period and
stopped, a little ashamed of his earnestness. He
sat up in the seat preparatory to returning to
his own wagon, then dropped his hand once
more on the boy&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m old enough to be your father, boy, and
have done, in all things, the reverse of what I
advised you. Therefore, I know I was wrong.
We may sneer and speak of poetry when the
words proceed from another, my boy; but, as
inevitable as death, there comes to every man
the knowledge that he stands accursed of Nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
who hasn&#8217;t heard the voice of his own
child call &#8216;father!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He clambered down, leaving the speechless
Ole sprawling on the wagon-seat. Back in his
own wagon, he smiled broadly to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange, how easily the apple falls when
it&#8217;s ripe,&#8221; he soliloquized.</p>
<p>They drove on clear to the mill without another
word; without even a grin from the broad-faced
Ole, who sat in ponderous thought in the
wagon ahead. To a nature such as his the infrequency
of a new idea gives it the force of a
cataclysm; during its presence, obliterating
everything else.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when they reached the
narrow fringe of trees and underbrush&ndash;&ndash;deciduous
and wind-tortured all&ndash;&ndash;which bordered
the big, muddy, low-lying Missouri; and soon
they could hear the throb of the engine at the
mill, and the swish of the saw through the green
lumber; a sound that heard near by, inevitably
carries the suggestion of scalpel and living
flesh. Nothing but green timber was sawed
thereabout in those days. The country was settling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
rapidly, lumber was imperative, and available
timber very, very limited.</p>
<p>Returning, the heavy loads grumbled slowly
along, so slowly that it was nearly evening, and
their shadows preceded them by rods when they
reached the little prairie town. They stopped
to water their teams; and Ole, true to the instincts
of his plebeian ancestry, went in search
of a glass of beer. He returned, quickly, his
face very red.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow in there is talking about&ndash;&ndash;about
Mrs. Maurice,&#8221; he blurted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the saloon, Ole?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swede repeated the story, watching the
tall man from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>A man, very drunk, was standing by the bar,
and telling how, in coming to town, he had seen
a buggy drive away from the Maurice home
very fast. He had thought it was the doctor&#8217;s
buggy and had stopped in to see if any one was
sick.</p>
<p>The fellow had grinned here and drank some
more, before finishing the story; the surrounding
audience winking at each other meanwhile,
and drinking in company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>Then he went on to tell how Camilla Maurice
had sat just inside the doorway, her face in
her hands, sobbing,&ndash;&ndash;so hard she hadn&#8217;t noticed
him; and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;it wasn&#8217;t the doctor who had
been there at all!</p>
<p>Ichabod had been holding a pail of water so
that a horse might drink. At the end he motioned
Ole very quietly, to take his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish watering them, and&ndash;&ndash;wait for me,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was far from what the Swede had expected;
but he accepted the task, obediently.</p>
<p>The only saloon of the town stood almost exactly
opposite Hans Becher&#8217;s place, flush with
the street. A long, low building, communicating
with the outer world by one door&ndash;&ndash;sans
glass&ndash;&ndash;its single window in front and at the
rear lit it but imperfectly at midday, and now at
early evening made faces almost indistinguishable,
and cast kindly shadow over the fly specks
and smoke stains of a low roof. A narrow pine
bar, redolent of tribute absorbed from innumerable
passing &#8220;schooners,&#8221; stretched the entire
length of the room at one side; and back of it,
in shirt sleeves and stained apron, presided the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
typical bar-keeper of the frontier. All this Ichabod
saw as he stepped inside; then, himself in
shadow, he studied the group before him.</p>
<p>Railroad and cattle men, mostly, made up
the gathering, with a scant sprinkling of farmers
and others unclassified. A big, ill-dressed
fellow was repeating the tale of scandal for the
benefit of a newcomer; the narrative moving
jerkily over hiccoughs, like hurdles.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;I drew up to th&#8217; house quick, an&#8217; went
up th&#8217; path quiet like,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he tapped thunderously
on the bar with a heavy glass for silence&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;quiet&ndash;&ndash;sh-h&ndash;&ndash;like;
an&#8217; when I come t&#8217; th&#8217;
door, ther&#8217; &#8217;t was open, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;as I hope&ndash;&ndash;hope
t&#8217; die,... drink on me, b&#8217;ys, aller y&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;set
&#8217;m up, Barney ol&#8217; b&#8217;y, m&#8217; treat,... hope
t&#8217; die, ther&#8217; she sat, like this&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
looked around mistily for a chair, but none was
convenient, and he slid flat to the floor in their
midst, his face in his hands, blubbering dismally
in imitation.... &#8220;Sat (hic) like this;
rockin&#8217; an&#8217; moanin&#8217; n&#8217; callin&#8217; his name: Asa&ndash;&ndash;Asa&ndash;&ndash;Asa&ndash;&ndash;(hic)
Arnold&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;shure &#8217;s I&#8217;m a
sinner she&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not finish. Very suddenly the surrounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
group had scattered, and he peered up
through maudlin tears to learn the cause. One
man alone stood above him. The room had
grown still as a church.</p>
<p>The drunken one blinked his watery eyes and
showed his yellow teeth in a convivial grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;d evnin&#8217;, pard.... Serve th&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;th&#8217;
gem&#8217;n, Barney; m&#8217; treat.&#8221; Again the teeth obtruded.
&#8220;Was jes&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221;</p>
<p>He of the story winked harder than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless m&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused for an expletive,
hiccoughed, and forgetting what had caused the
halt, stumbled on:&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Didn&#8217; rec&#8217;gniz&#8217; y&#8217; b&#8217;fore.
Shake, ol&#8217; boy. S&ndash;&ndash;sh-sorry for y&#8217;.&#8221;
Tears rose copiously. &#8220;Tough&ndash;&ndash;when feller&#8217;s
wife&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Interrupting suddenly a muffled sound like
the distant exhaust of a big engine&ndash;&ndash;the meeting
of a heavy boot with an obstacle on the
floor. &#8220;Get up!&#8221;</p>
<p>A very mountain of human brawn resolved
itself upward; a hand on its hips; a curse on its
lips.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You damned lantern-faced&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; No hiccough now,
but a pause from pure physical impotence,
pending a doubtful struggle against a
half-dozen men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Order, gentlemen!&#8221; demanded the bar-keeper,
adding emphasis by hammering a heavy
bottle on the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; commanded Ichabod very
quietly; but they all heard through the confusion.
&#8220;Let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country was by no means the wild West
of the story-papers, but it was primitive, and no
man thought, then, of preventing the obviously
inevitable.</p>
<p>Ichabod held up his hand, suggestively, imperatively,
and the crowd fell back, silent,&ndash;&ndash;leaving
him facing the big man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll apologize!&#8221; The thin jaw showed
clear, through the shade of brown stubble on
Ichabod&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>For answer, the big man leaning on the bar
exhibited his discolored teeth and breathed
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall it be?&#8221; asked Ichabod.</p>
<p>A grimy hand twitched toward a grimier hip.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the likes of this&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Ichabod turned toward the spectators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will any man lend me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And give us a little light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside,&#8221; suggested the saloon-keeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not advertising patent medicine,&#8221;
blazed Ichabod, and the lamps were lit immediately.</p>
<p>Once more the long-visaged man appealed to
the group lined up now against the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen&ndash;&ndash;I never carried a revolver a
half-hour in my life. Is it any more than fair
that I name the details?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Name &#8217;m and be quick,&#8221; acquiesced his big
opponent before the others could speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Mr. Duggin,&#8221; with equal swiftness.
&#8220;These, then, are the conditions.&#8221; For
three seconds, that seemed a minute, Ichabod
looked steadily between his adversary&#8217;s bushy
eyebrows. &#8220;The conditions,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;are,
that starting from opposite ends of the room,
we don&#8217;t fire until our toes touch in the middle
line.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; commended a voice; but it was not
big Duggin who spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s done, too,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;added a listening
cattleman, grasping Ichabod by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The building had been designed as a bowling-alley
and was built the entire length of the lot.
With an alacrity born of experience, the long
space opposite the bar was cleared, and the belligerents
stationed one at either end, their faces
toward the wall. Midway between them a
heavy line had been drawn with chalk, and beside
it stood a half-dozen grim men, their hands
resting suggestively on their hips. The room
was again very quiet, and from out-of-doors
penetrated the shrill sound of a schoolboy
whistling &#8220;Annie Laurie&#8221; with original variations.
So exotic seemed the entire scene in its
prairie setting, that it might have been transferred
bodily from the stage of a distant theatre
and set down here,&ndash;&ndash;by mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; directed a voice. &#8220;You understand,
men. You&#8217;re to face and walk to the line.
When your feet touch&ndash;&ndash;fire; and,&#8221; warningly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
not before. Ready, gentlemen.
Turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod faced about, the cocked revolver in
his hand, the name Asa Arnold singing in his
ears. A terrible cold-white anger was in his
heart against the man opposite, who had publicly
caused the resurrection of this hated,
buried thing. For a moment it blotted out all
other sensations; then, rushing, crowding came
other thoughts,&ndash;&ndash;vision from boyhood down.
In the space of seconds, faded scenes of the
dead past took on sudden color and as suddenly
vanished. Faces, he had forgotten for years,
flashed instantaneously into view. Voices long
hushed in oblivion, re-embodied, spoke in accents
as familiar as his own. Inwardly he was
seething with the myriad shifting pictures of a
drowning man. Outwardly he walked those
half-score steps to the line, unflinchingly; came
to certain death,&ndash;&ndash;and waited: personification
of all that is cool and deliberate&ndash;&ndash;of the sudden
abundant nerve in emergencies which
comes only to the highly evolved.</p>
<p>Duggin, the big man, turned likewise at the
word and came part way swiftly; then stopped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
his face very pale. Another step he took, with
another pause, and with great drops of perspiration
gathering on his face, and on the backs of
his hands. Yet another start, and he came very
near; so near that he gazed into the blue of
Ichabod&#8217;s eyes. They seemed to him now devil&#8217;s
eyes, and he halted, looking at them, fingering
the weapon in his hand, his courage oozing at
every pore.</p>
<p>Out of those eyes and that long, thin face
stared death; not hot, sudden death, but nihility,
cool, deliberate, that waited for one! The big
beads on his forehead gathered in drops and ran
down his cheeks. He tried to move on, but his
legs only trembled beneath him. The hopeless,
unreasoning terror of the frightened animal, the
raw recruit, the superstitious negro, was upon
him. The last fragment of self-respect, of
bravado even, was in tatters. No object on
earth, no fear of hereafter, could have made
him face death in that way, with those eyes
looking into his.</p>
<p>The weapon shook from Duggin&#8217;s hand to
the floor,&ndash;&ndash;with a sound like the first clatter of
gravel on a coffin lid; and in abasement absolute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
he dropped his head; his hands nerveless, his
jaw trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;and your wife&#8217;s,&#8221; he
faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all a lie? You were drunk?&#8221; Ichabod
crossed the line, standing over him.</p>
<p>A rustle and a great snort of contempt went
around the room; but Duggin still felt those
terrible eyes upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very drunk. It was all a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without another word Ichabod turned away,
and almost immediately the other men followed,
the door closing behind them. Only the bar-keeper
stood impassive, watching.</p>
<p>That instant the red heat of the liquor returned
to the big man&#8217;s brain and he picked up
the revolver. Muttering, he staggered over
to the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&ndash;&ndash;n him&ndash;&ndash;the hide-faced&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he cursed.
&#8220;Gimme a drink, Barney. Whiskey, straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never another drop in my place so long as
I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barney, damn you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get out! You coward!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Barney&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not another word. Go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Duggin was sober as he stumbled out
into the evening.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ichabod moved slowly up the street, months
aged in those last few minutes. Reaction was
inevitable, and with it the future instead of the
present, stared him in the face. He had
crowded the lie down the man&#8217;s throat, but
well he knew it had been useless. The story
was true, and it would spread; no power of
his could prevent. He could not deceive himself,
even. That name! Again the white anger
born of memory, flooded him. Curses on the
name and on the man who had spoken it! Why
must the fellow have turned coward at the last
moment? Had they but touched feet over the
line&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Suddenly Ichabod stopped, his hands pressed
to his head. Camilla, home&ndash;&ndash;alone! And he
had forgotten! He hurried back to the waiting
Swede, an anathema that was not directed at
another, hot on his lips.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All ready, Ole,&#8221; he announced, clambering
to the seat.</p>
<p>The boy handed up the lines lingeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, sir.&#8221; Then uncontrollable, long-repressed
curiosity broke the bounds of deference.
&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;heard him, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ole edged toward his own wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duggin swore it was a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He swore it was false, I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>They drove out into the prairie and the night;
the stars looking down, smiling, as in the morning
which was so long ago, the man had smiled,&ndash;&ndash;looking
upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiny, tiny mortal,&#8221; they twinkled, each to
the other. &#8220;So small and hot, and rebellious.
Tiny, tiny, mortal!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man covered his face with his hands,
shutting them out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter VI&ndash;&ndash;By a Candle&#8217;s Flame</span></h3>
<p>Asa Arnold sat in the small upstairs
room at the hotel of Hans Becher. It
was the same room that Ichabod and Camilla
had occupied when they first arrived; but he
did not know that. Even had he known, however,
it would have made slight difference;
nothing could have kept them more constantly
in his mind than they were at this time. He
had not slept any the night before; a fact which
would have spoken loudly to one who knew him
well; and this morning he was very tired. He
lounged low in the oak chair, his feet on the
bed, the usual big cigar in his mouth.</p>
<p>This morning, the perspective of the little
man was anything but normal. Worse than
that, he could not reduce it to the normal, try
as he might.</p>
<p>His meeting with Camilla yesterday had
produced a deep and abiding shock; for either
of them to have been so moved signified the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
stirring of dangerous forces. They&ndash;&ndash;and
especially himself&ndash;&ndash;who had always accepted
life, even crises, so calmly; who had heretofore
laughed at all display of emotion&ndash;&ndash;for them
to have acted as they had, for them to have
spoken to each other the things they had spoken,
the things they could not forget, that he never
could forgive&ndash;&ndash;it was unbelievable! It upset
all the established order of things!</p>
<p>His anger of yesterday against Camilla had
died out. She was not to blame; she was a
woman, and women were all alike. He had
thought differently before; that she was an
exception; but now he knew better. One and
all they were mere puppets of emotion, and
fickle.</p>
<p>In a measure, though, as he had excused
Camilla he had incriminated Ichabod. Ichabod
was the guilty one, and a man. Ichabod had
filched from him his possession of most value;
and without even the form of a by-your-leave.
The incident of last evening at the saloon (for
he had heard of it in the hour, as had every one
in the little town) had but served to make more
implacable his resentment. By the satire of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
circumstances it had come about that he again,
Asa Arnold, had been the cause of another&#8217;s
defending the honor of his own wife,&ndash;&ndash;for she
was his wife as yet,&ndash;&ndash;and that other, the defender,
was Ichabod Maurice!</p>
<p>The little man&#8217;s face did not change at the
thought. He only smoked harder, until the
room was blue; but though he did not put
the feeling in words even to himself, he knew in
the depths of his own mind that the price of
that last day was death. Whether it was his
own death, or the death of Ichabod, he did not
know; he did not care; but that one of them
must die was inevitable. Horrible as was the
thought, it had no terror for him, now. He
wondered that it did not have; but, on the contrary,
it seemed to him very ordinary, even
logical&ndash;&ndash;as one orders a dinner when he is
hungry.</p>
<p>He lit another cigar, calmly. It was this very
imperturbability of the little man which made
him terrible. Like a great movement of
Nature, it was awful from its very resistlessness;
its imperviability to appeal. Steadily, as
he had lit the cigar, he smoked until the air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
became bluer than before. In a ghastly way,
he was trying to decide whose death it should
be,&ndash;&ndash;as one decides a winter&#8217;s flitting, whether
to Florida or California; only now the question
was: should it be suicide, or,&ndash;&ndash;as in the saloon
yesterday,&ndash;&ndash;leave the decision to Chance? For
the time the personal equation was eliminated;
the man weighed the evidence as impartially as
though he were deciding the fate of another.</p>
<p>He sat long and very still; until even in the
daylight the red cigar-end grew redder in the
haze. Without being conscious of the fact, he
was probably doing the most unselfish thinking
of his life. What the result of that thought
would have been no man will ever know, for of
a sudden, interrupting, Hans Becher&#8217;s round
face appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ichabod Maurice to see you,&#8221; coughed the
German, obscured in the cloud of smoke which
passed out like steam through the opening.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that Asa Arnold&#8217;s face
grew impassive; it was that already. Certain it
was, though, that behind the mask there occurred,
at that moment, a revolution. Born of
it, the old mocking smile sprang to his lips.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The devil fights for his own,&#8221; he soliloquized.
&#8220;I really believe I,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;again the smile,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
was about to make a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Hans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The German&#8217;s jaw dropped in inexpressible
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made a decision for me, then. Thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Maurice I shall be pleased to see
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round face disappeared from the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Donnerwetter!</i>&#8221; commented the little landlord
in the safe seclusion of the stairway. Later,
in relating the incident to Minna, he tapped his
forehead, suggestively.</p>
<p>Ichabod climbed the stair alone. &#8220;To your
old room,&#8221; Hans had said; and Ichabod knew
the place well. He knocked on the panel, a voice
answered: &#8220;Come,&#8221; and he opened the door.
Arnold had thrown away his cigar and opened
the window. The room was clearing rapidly.</p>
<p>Ichabod stepped inside and closed the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
carefully behind him. A few seconds he stood
holding it, then swung it open quickly and
glanced down the hallway. Answering, there
was a sudden, scuttling sound, not unlike the
escape of frightened rats, as Hans Becher precipitately
disappeared. The tall man came
back and for the second time slowly closed the
door.</p>
<p>Asa Arnold had neither moved nor spoken
since that first word,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;come&#8221;; and the self-invited
visitor read the inaction correctly. No
man, with the knowledge Ichabod possessed,
could have misunderstood the challenge in that
impassive face. No man, a year ago, would have
accepted that challenge more quickly. Now&ndash;&ndash;But
God only knew whether or no he would
forget,&ndash;&ndash;now.</p>
<p>For a minute, which to an onlooker would
have seemed interminable, the two men faced
each other. Up from the street came the ring
of a heavy hammer on a sweet-voiced anvil, as
Jim Donovan, the blacksmith, sharpened anew
the breaking ploughs which were battling the
prairie sod for bread. In the street below, a
group of farmers were swapping yarns, an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
occasional chorus of guffaws interrupting to
punctuate the narrative. The combatants
heard it all, as one hears the drone of the cicada
on a sleepy summer day; at the moment, as a
mere colorless background which later, Time,
the greater adjuster, utilizes to harmonize the
whole memory.</p>
<p>Ichabod had been standing; now he sat down
upon the bed, his long legs stretched out before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be useless for us to temporize,&#8221; he
initiated. &#8220;I&#8217;ve intruded my presence in order
to ask you a question.&#8221; The long fingers locked
slowly over his knees. &#8220;What is your object
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The innate spirit of mockery sprang to the
little man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; he smiled; &#8220;so far mistaken,
that instead of your visit being an intrusion,
I expected you&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;an amending memory
came to him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;although I wasn&#8217;t looking for
you quite so soon, perhaps.&#8221; He paused for an
instant, and the smile left his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to the statement of object. I think&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;slowly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a
disinterested observer would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
put the question you ask into my mouth.&#8221; He
stared his tall visitor up and down critically,
menacingly. Of a sudden, irresistibly, a very
convulsion shot over his face. &#8220;God, man,
you&#8217;re brazen!&#8221; he commented cumulatively.</p>
<p>Ichabod had gambled with this man in the
past, and had seen him lose half he possessed
without the twitch of an eyelid. A force which
now could cause that sudden change of expression&ndash;&ndash;no
man on earth knew, better than
Ichabod, its intensity. Perhaps a shade of the
same feeling crept into his own answering voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll quarrel later, if you wish,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;swiftly.
&#8220;Neither of us can afford to do
so now. I ask you again, what are your intentions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I repeat, the question is by right mine.
It&#8217;s not I who&#8217;ve changed my name and&ndash;&ndash;and
in other things emulated the hero of the yellow-back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod&#8217;s face turned a shade paler, though
his answer was calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known each other too well for either
to attempt explanation or condemnation. You
wish me to testify first.&#8221; The long fingers unclasped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
from over his knee. &#8220;You know the
story of the past year: it&#8217;s the key to the
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile, sardonic, distinctive, lifted the tips
of Arnold&#8217;s big moustaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your faith in your protecting gods is certainly
beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod nursed a callous spot on one palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;very slowly. &#8220;At least,
you&#8217;ll answer my question now, perhaps,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure. You intimate the future
will be but a repetition of the past. It&#8217;ll be my
endeavor to give that statement the lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You insist on quarrelling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist on but one thing,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;swiftly. &#8220;That
you never again come into my sight, or into the
sight of my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of Ichabod&#8217;s long hands extended in
gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I insist you shall never again use the
name of Camilla Maurice as your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old mocking smile sprang to Asa
Arnold&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unconsciously, you&#8217;re amusing,&#8221; he derided.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
&#8220;The old story of the mouse who forbids
the cat.... You forget, man, she is
my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod stood up, seemingly longer and
gaunter than ever before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God, Arnold,&#8221; he flashed, &#8220;haven&#8217;t
you the faintest element of pride, or of consistency
in your make-up? Is it necessary for a
woman to tell you more than once that she hates
you? By your own statement your marriage,
even at first, was merely of convenience; but
even if this weren&#8217;t so, every principle of the
belief you hold releases her. Before God, or
man, you haven&#8217;t the slightest claim, and you
know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asa Arnold did not stir, but the pupils of
his eyes grew wider, until the whole eye seemed
black.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; he accented slowly. &#8220;You
brazen egoist! Did it never occur to you that
others than yourself could love?&#8221;</p>
<p>Score for the little man. Ichabod had been
pinked first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You dare tell me to my face you loved
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; blazed Ichabod. &#8220;Every word
and action of your life gives you the lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not five minutes had passed since he came
in and already he had forgotten!</p>
<p>Asa Arnold likewise was upon his feet and
they two faced each other,&ndash;&ndash;a bed length between;
in their minds the past and future a
blank, the present with its primitive animal
hate blazing in their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what it means to tell me that.&#8221;
Arnold&#8217;s voice was a full note higher than usual.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll apologize?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never. It&#8217;s true. You lied, and you know
you lied.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surrounding world turned dark to the
little man, and the dry-goods box with the tin
dipper on its top, danced before his eyes. For
the first time in his memory he felt himself
losing self-control, and by main force of will he
turned away to the window. For the instant
all the savage of his nature was on the surface,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and he could fairly feel his fingers gripping at
the tall man&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>A moment he stood in the narrow south
window, full in the smiling irony of Nature&#8217;s
sunshine; but only a moment. Then the mocking
smile that had become an instinctive part of
his nature spread over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see but one way to settle this difficulty,&#8221;
he intimated.</p>
<p>A taunt sprang to Ichabod&#8217;s tongue, but was
as quickly repressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is but one, unless&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; with meaning
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat, there is but one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod&#8217;s long face held like wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider yourself, then, the challenged
party.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were both very calm, now; the immediate
exciting cause in the mind of neither. It
seemed as if they had been expecting this time
for years, had been preparing for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, as yesterday, in the saloon?&#8221; The
points of the big moustaches twitched ironically.
&#8220;I promise you there&#8217;ll be no procrastination
as&ndash;&ndash;at certain cases recorded.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>The mockery, malice inspired, was cleverly
turned, and Ichabod&#8217;s big chin protruded ominously,
as he came over and fairly towered
above the small man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly it&#8217;ll not be as yesterday.
If we&#8217;re going to reverse civilization, we may
as well roll it away back. We&#8217;ll settle it alone,
and here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asa Arnold smiled up into the blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d prefer to make the adjustment with
your hands, too, perhaps? There&#8217;d be less risk,
considering&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He stopped at the look on the
face above his. No man <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> with Ichabod
Maurice ever made accusation of cowardice.
Instead, instinctive sarcasm leaped to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being of the West, I don&#8217;t ordinarily
carry an arsenal with me, in anticipation of such
incidents as these. If you&#8217;re prepared, however,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
and he paused again.</p>
<p>Ichabod turned away; a terrible weariness
and disgust of it all&ndash;&ndash;of life, himself, the little
man,&ndash;&ndash;in his face. A tragedy would not be
so bad, but this lingering comedy of death&ndash;&ndash;One
thing alone was in his mind: to have it over,
and quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect&ndash;&ndash;this, either. We&#8217;ll find
another way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced about the room. A bed, the improvised
commode, a chair, a small table with a
book upon it, and a tallow candle&ndash;&ndash;an idea
came to him, and his search terminated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may&ndash;&ndash;suggest&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod took up the candle, and, with his
pocket-knife, cut it down until it was a mere
stub in the socket, then lit a match and held the
flame to the wick, until the tallow sputtered
into burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can estimate when that light will go
out?&#8221; he intimated impassively.</p>
<p>Asa Arnold watched the tall man, steadily,
as the latter returned the candle to the table and
drew out his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>
<p>Ichabod returned to his seat on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not afraid, perhaps, to go into the
dark alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By your own hand?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; again, very slowly. Arnold understood
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You swear?&#8221; Ichabod flashed a glance
with the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment they both studied the sputtering
candle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be within fifteen minutes,&#8221; randomed
Ichabod.</p>
<p>Arnold drew out his watch slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. Each had made his choice; a
trivial matter of one second in the candle&#8217;s life
would decide which of these two men would die
by his own hand.</p>
<p>For a minute there was no sound. They
could not even hear their breathing. Then
Arnold cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say when the loser must pay his
debt,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>Ichabod&#8217;s voice in answer was a trifle husky.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221; A vision of the
future flashed, sinister, inevitable. &#8220;The man
who loses won&#8217;t care to face the necessity long.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Five minutes more passed. Down the street
the blacksmith was hammering steadily. Beneath
the window the group of farmers had
separated; their departing footsteps tapping
into distance and silence.</p>
<p>Minna went to the street door, calling loudly
for Hans, Jr., who had strayed,&ndash;&ndash;and both
men started at the sound. The quick catch of
their breathing was now plainly audible.</p>
<p>Arnold shifted in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You swear&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; his voice rang unnaturally
sharp, and he paused to moisten his throat,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you
swear before God you&#8217;ll abide by this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear before God,&#8221; repeated Ichabod
slowly.</p>
<p>A second, and the little man followed in echo.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&ndash;&ndash;I swear, I, too, will abide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither man remembered that one of this
twain, who gave oath before the Deity, was an
agnostic, the other an atheist!</p>
<p>A lonely south wind was rising, and above
the tinkle of the blacksmith&#8217;s hammer there
sounded the tap of the light shade as it flapped
in the wind against the window-pane. Low,
drowsy, moaning,&ndash;&ndash;typical breath of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
prairie,&ndash;&ndash;it droned through the loosely built house,
with sound louder, but not unlike the perpetual
roar of a great sea-shell.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed, and the men sat very
still. Both their faces were white, and in the
angle of the jaw of each the muscles were locked
hard. Ichabod was leaning near the candle. It
sputtered and a tiny globule of hot tallow
struck his face. He winced and wiped the drop
off quickly. Observing, Arnold smiled and
opened his lips as if to make comment; then
closed them suddenly, and the smile passed.</p>
<p>Two minutes more the watches ticked off;
very, very slowly. Neither of the men had
thought, beforehand, of this time of waiting.
Big drops of sweat were forming on both their
faces, and in the ears of each the blood sang
madly. A haze, as from the dropping of a
shade, seemed to have formed and hung over
the room, and in unison sounds from without
acquired a certain faintness, like that born of
distance. Through it all the two men sat
motionless, watching the candle and the time,
as the fascinated bird watches its charmer; as
the subject watches the hypnotist,&ndash;&ndash;as if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
passive exercise were the one imperative thing
in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirteen minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Arnold was counting aloud.
The flame was very low, now, and he started to
move his chair closer, then sank back, a smile,
almost ghastly, upon his lips. The blaze had
reached the level of the socket, and was growing
smaller and smaller. Two minutes yet to burn!
He had lost.</p>
<p>He tried to turn his eyes away, but they
seemed fastened to the spot, and he powerless.
It was as though death, from staring him in the
face, had suddenly gripped him hard. The
panorama of his past life flashed through his
mind. The thoughts of the drowning man, of
the miner who hears the rumble of crumbling
earth, of the prisoner helpless and hopeless
who feels the first touch of flame,&ndash;&ndash;common
thought of all these were his; and in a space of
time which, though seeming to him endless, was
in reality but seconds.</p>
<p>Then came the duller reaction and the events
of the last few minutes repeated themselves, impersonally,
spectacularly,&ndash;&ndash;as though they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
were the actions of another man; one for
whom he felt very sorry. He even went into
the future and saw this same man lying down
with a tiny bottle in his hand, preparing for
the sleep from which there would be no awakening,&ndash;&ndash;the
sleep which, in anticipation, seemed
so pleasant.</p>
<p>Concomitant with this thought the visionary
shaded into the real, and there came the determination
to act at once, this very afternoon, as
soon as Ichabod had gone. He even felt a little
relief at the decision. After all, it was so much
simpler than if he had won, for then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;He
laughed gratingly at the thought. Cursed
if he would have known what to have done,
then!</p>
<p>The sound roused him and he looked at his
watch. A minute had passed, fourteen from
the first and the flame still sputtered. Was it
possible after all&ndash;&ndash;after he had decided&ndash;&ndash;that
he was not to lose, that the decision was unnecessary?
There was not in his mind the slightest
feeling of personal elation at the prospect, but
rather a sense of injury that such a scurvy trick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
should be foisted off upon him. It was like
going to a funeral and being confronted, suddenly,
with the grinning head of the supposed
dead projecting through the coffin lid. It was
unseemly!</p>
<p>Only a minute more: a half now&ndash;&ndash;yes, he
would win. For the first time he felt that his
forehead was wet, and he mopped his face with
his handkerchief jerkily; then sank back in the
chair, instinctively shooting forward his cuffs
in motion habitual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen seconds.&#8221; There could be no question
now of the result; and the outside world,
banished for the once, returned. The blacksmith
was hammering again, the strokes two
seconds apart, and the fancy seized the little
man to finish counting by the ring of the anvil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve, ten, eight,&#8221; he counted slowly.
&#8220;Six&#8221; was forming on the tip of the tongue
when of a sudden the tiny flame veered far over
toward the holder, sputtered and went out. For
the first time in those interminable minutes,
Arnold looked at his companion. Ichabod&#8217;s
face was within a foot of the table, and in line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
with the direction the flame had veered. Swift
as thought the small man was on his feet, white
anger in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You blew that candle!&#8221; he challenged.</p>
<p>Ichabod&#8217;s head dropped into his hands. An
awful horror of himself fell crushingly upon
him; an abhorrence of the selfishness that could
have forgotten&ndash;&ndash;what he forgot; and for so
long,&ndash;&ndash;almost irrevocably long. Mingled with
this feeling was a sudden thanksgiving for the
boon of which he was unworthy; the memory
at the eleventh hour, in time to do as he had
done before his word was passed. Arnold
strode across the room, his breath coming fast,
his eyes flashing fire. He shook the tall man
by the shoulder roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You blew that flame, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod looked up at the furious, dark face
almost in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I blew it,&#8221; he corroborated absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have burned longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arnold moved back a step and the old smile,
mocking, maddening, spread over his face;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
tilting, perpendicular, the tips of the big
moustaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; very slowly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;after all,
then, you&#8217;re a coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall man stood up; six-feet-two, long,
bony, immovable: Ichabod himself again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll meet me again,&ndash;&ndash;another way,
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat, you&#8217;re a cursed coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be a coward if I did meet you,&#8221; quickly.</p>
<p>Something in Ichabod&#8217;s voice caught the little
man&#8217;s ear and held him silent, as, for a long
half-minute, the last time in their lives, the two
men looked into each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll perhaps explain.&#8221; Arnold&#8217;s voice
was cold as death. &#8220;You have a reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod walked slowly over to the window
and leaned against the frame. Standing there,
the spring sunshine fell full upon his face,
drawing clear the furrows at the angles of his
eyes and the gray threads of his hair. He
paused a moment, looking out over the broad
prairie shimmering indistinctly in the heat, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the calm of it all took hold of him, shone in his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a reason,&#8221; very measuredly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
not that I fear death, or you.&#8221; He took up his
hat and smoothed it absently. &#8220;In future I
shall neither seek, nor avoid you. Do what you
wish&ndash;&ndash;and God judge us both.&#8221; Without a
glance at the other man, he turned toward the
door.</p>
<p>Arnold moved a step, as if to prevent him
going.</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat, it&#8217;s my right to know why you
refuse.&#8221; His feet shifted uneasily upon the
floor. &#8220;Is it because of another&ndash;&ndash;Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ichabod paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; very slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s because of
Eleanor&ndash;&ndash;<i>and</i> another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall man&#8217;s hand was upon the knob, but
this time there was no interruption. An instant
he hesitated; then absently, slowly, the door
opened and closed. A moment later indistinct,
descending steps sounded on the stairway.</p>
<p>Alone, Asa Arnold stood immovable, looking
blindly at the closed door, listening until the
tapping feet had passed into silence. Then, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
a motion indescribable, of pain and of abandon,
he sank back into the single chair.</p>
<p>His dearest enemy would have pitied the
little man at that moment!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter VII&ndash;&ndash;The Price of the Leap</span></h3>
<p>In the chronology of the little town, day
followed day, as monotonously as ticks the
tall clock on the wall. Only in multiple they
merged into the seasons which glided so
smoothly, one into the other, that the change
was unnoticed, until it had taken place.</p>
<p>Thus three months passed by, and man&#8217;s
work for the year was nearly done. The face
of the prairie had become one of many colors;
eternal badge of civilization as opposed to Nature,
who paints each season with its own hue.
Beside the roadways great, rank sunflowers
turned their glaring yellow faces to the light.
In every direction stretched broad fields of flax;
unequally ripening, their color scheme ranging
from sky blue of blossoms to warm browns of
maturity. Blotches of sod corn added here and
there a dash of green to the picture. Surrounding
all, a setting for all, the unbroken virgin
prairie, mottled green and brown, stretched,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
smiling, harmonious, beneficent; a land of
promise and of plenty for generations yet
unborn.</p>
<p>All through the long, hot summer Asa
Arnold had stayed in town, smoking a big
pipe in front of the hotel of Hans Becher.
Indolent, abnormally indolent, a stranger seeing
him thus would have commented; but, save
Hans the confiding, none other of the many
interested observers were deceived. No man
merely indolent sleeps neither by night nor by
day; and it seemed the little man never slept.
No man merely indolent sits wide-eyed hour
after hour, gazing blankly at the earth beneath
his feet&ndash;&ndash;and uttering never a word. Brooding,
not dreaming, was Asa Arnold; brooding
over the eternal problem of right and wrong.
And, as passed the slow weeks, he moved back&ndash;&ndash;back
on the trail of civilization, back until
Passion and not Reason was the god enthroned;
back until one thought alone was with him
morning, noon, and night,&ndash;&ndash;and that thought
preponderant, overmastering, deadly hate.</p>
<p>Observant Curtis, the doctor, shrugged his
shoulders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The old, old trail,&#8221; he satirized.</p>
<p>It was to Bud Evans, the little agent, that he
made the observation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which has no ending,&#8221; completed the latter.</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged afresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has one inevitable termination,&#8221; he
refuted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madness&ndash;&ndash;sheer madness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent was silent a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the end of that?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>Curtis pursed his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tragedy, or a strait-jacket. The former,
in this instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evans was silent longer than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really mean that?&#8221; he queried at
last, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve warned Maurice,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;sententiously. &#8220;I
can do no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he?&#8221; quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two friends looked at each other,
steadily; yet, though they said no more, each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
knew the thought of the other, each knew that
in future no move of Asa Arnold&#8217;s would pass
unnoticed, unchallenged.</p>
<p>Again, weeks, a month, passed without incident.
It was well along in the fall and of an
early evening that a vague rumor of the unusual
passed swiftly, by word of mouth,
throughout the tiny town. Only a rumor it
was, but sufficient to set every man within
hearing in motion.</p>
<p>On this night Hans Becher had eaten his
supper and returned to the hotel office, as was
his wont, for an evening smoke, when, without
apparent reason, Bud Evans and Jim Donovan,
the blacksmith, came quietly in and sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evening,&#8221; they nodded, and looked about
them.</p>
<p>A minute later Dr. Curtis and Hank Judge,
the machine man, dropped unostentatiously
into chairs. They likewise muttered &#8220;Evening,&#8221;
and made observation from under their
hat-brims. Others followed rapidly, until the
room was full and dark figures waited outside.
At last Curtis spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your boarder, Asa Arnold, where is he,
Hans?&#8221;</p>
<p>The unsuspecting German blew a cloud of
smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;He a while ago went out.&#8221; Then, as an
afterthought: &#8220;He will return soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence once more for a time, and a steadily
thickening haze of smoke in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he have supper, Hans?&#8221; queried Bud
Evans, impatiently.</p>
<p>Again the German&#8217;s face expressed surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is waiting for him. He went to shoot
a rabbit he saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men were on their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;He took a gun, Hans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A rifle, to be sure.&#8221; The mild brown eyes
glanced up reproachfully. &#8220;A man does not
go hunting without&ndash;&ndash;... What is this!&#8221;
he completed in consternation, as, finding himself
suddenly alone, he hurried outside and
stood confusedly scratching his bushy poll, in
the block of light surrounding the open doorway.</p>
<p>The yard was deserted. As one snuffs a
candle, the men had vanished. Hans&#8217; pipe had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
gone out and he went inside for a match.
Though the stars fell, the German must needs
smoke. Only a minute he was gone, but during
that time a group of horsemen had gathered in
the street. Others were coming across lots, and
still others were emerging from the darkness of
alleys. Some were mounted; some led by the
rein, wiry little bronchos. Watching, it almost
seemed to the German that they sprang from
the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all ready?&#8221; called a voice, Bud
Evans&#8217; voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sudden, confused trampling, as
of cattle in stampede; a musical creaking of
heavy saddles; a knife-like swish of many quirts
through the air; a chorus of dull, chesty groans
as the rowels of long spurs bit the flanks of the
mustangs, and they were gone&ndash;&ndash;down the narrow
street, out upon the prairie, their hoof beats
pattering <i>diminuendo</i> into silence; a cloud of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
dust, grayish in the starlight, marking the way
they had taken.</p>
<p>Jim Donovan, the blacksmith, came running
excitedly up from a side street. He stopped in
front of the hotel, breathlessly. Holding his
sides, he followed with his eyes the trail of dust
leading out into the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they gone?&#8221; he panted. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
find another horse in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it to?&#8221; sputtered the German.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they gone, I say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never make it.&#8221; The blacksmith
mopped his brow with conviction. &#8220;He has an
hour&#8217;s start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans grasped the big man by the coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is too late?&#8221; he emphasized. &#8220;Where
are they going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Donovan turned about, great pity for
such density in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible you don&#8217;t understand? It&#8217;s
to Ichabod Maurice&#8217;s they&#8217;re going, to tell him
of Arnold.&#8221; The speaker mopped his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
anew. &#8220;It&#8217;s useless though. They&#8217;re too late,&#8221;
he completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Arnold is not there,&#8221; protested the
German. &#8220;He went for a rabbit, out on the
breaking. He so told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lied to you. He&#8217;s mad. I tell you
they&#8217;re too late,&#8221; repeated the smith, obstinately.</p>
<p>Hans clung tenaciously to the collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one knew and told them?&#8221; He
pointed in the direction the dust indicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Bud Evans; but they wouldn&#8217;t believe
him at first, and&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;bitterly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and
waited.&#8221; Donovan shook himself free, and
started down the walk. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed,&#8221;
he announced conclusively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cloud of dust was moving
out over the prairie like the wind. The pace
was terrific, and the tough little ponies were
soon puffing steadily. Small game, roused
from its sleep by the roadside, sprang winging
into the night. Once a coyote, surprised, ran a
distance confusedly ahead in the roadway; then,
an indistinct black ball, it vanished amongst the
tall grass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>Well out on the prairie, Bud Evans, the
leader, raised in his stirrups and looked ahead.
There was no light beyond where the little cottage
should be. The rowels of his spur dug
anew at the flank of his pony as he turned a
voice like a fog-horn back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The place is dark, boys,&#8221; he called.
&#8220;Hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answering, a muttering sound, not unlike an
approaching storm, passed along the line, and
in accompaniment the quirts cut the air anew.</p>
<p>Silent as the grave was the little farmstead
when, forty odd minutes from the time of starting,
they steamed up at the high fence bounding
the yard. One of Ichabod&#8217;s farm horses
whinnied a lone greeting from the barn as they
hastily dismounted and swarmed within the
inclosure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re too late,&#8221; prophesied a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad my name&#8217;s not Arnold, if we are,&#8221;
responded another, threateningly.</p>
<p>Hurrying up the path in advance, the little
land-agent stumbled over a soft, dark object,
and a curse fell from his lips as he recognized
the dead body of the big collie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re too late,&#8221; he echoed.</p>
<p>The door of the house swung ajar, creaking
upon its hinges; and, as penetrates the advance
wave of a flood, the men swarmed through the
doorway inside, until the narrow room was
blocked. Simultaneously, like torches, lighted
matches appeared aloft in their hands, and the
tiny whitewashed room flashed into light. As
simultaneously there sprang from the mouth of
each man an oath, and another, and another.
Waiting outside, not a listener but knew the
meaning of that sound; and big, hairy faces
crowded tightly to the one small window.</p>
<p>For a moment not a man in the line stirred.
Death was to them no stranger; but death such
as this&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>In more than one hand the match burned
down until it left a mark like charcoal, and
without calling attention. One and all they
stood spellbound, their eyes on the floor, their
lips unconsciously uttering the speech universal
of anger and of horror, the instinctive language
of anathema.</p>
<p>On the floor, sprawling, as falls a lifeless
body, lay the long Ichabod. On his forehead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
almost geometrically near the centre, was a tiny,
black spot, around it a lighter red blotch; his
face otherwise very white; his hair, on the side
toward which he leaned, a little matted; that
was all.</p>
<p>Prostrate across him, in an attitude of utter
abandon, reposed the body of a woman, soft,
graceful, motionless now as that of the man:
the body of Camilla Maurice. One hand had
held his head and was stained dark. On her lips
was another stain, but lighter. The meaning of
that last mark came as a flash to the spectators,
and the room grew still as the figures on the
floor.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the silence the men caught their
breath, with the quick guttural note that announces
the unexpected. That there was no
remaining life they had taken for granted&ndash;&ndash;and
Camilla&#8217;s lips had moved! They stared as
at sight of a ghost; all except Curtis, the
physician.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lamp, men,&#8221; he demanded, pressing his
ear to Camilla&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me here, Evans,&#8221; he continued without
turning. &#8220;I think she&#8217;s fainted is all,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
together they carried their burden into the tiny
sleeping-room, closing the door behind.</p>
<p>That instant Ole, the Swede, thrust a curious
head in at the outer doorway. He had noticed
the light and the gathering, and came to ascertain
their meaning. Wondering, his big eyes
passed around the waiting group and from them
to the floor. With that look self-consciousness
left him; he crowded to the front, bending over
the tall man and speaking his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Maurice,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Mr. Maurice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snatched off his own coat, rolling it under
Ichabod&#8217;s head, and with his handkerchief
touched the dark spot on the forehead. It
was clotted already and hardening, and realization
came to the boy Swede. He stood up,
facing the men, the big veins in his throat
throbbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did this?&#8221; he thundered, crouching
for a spring like a great dog. &#8220;Who did this, I
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the call to action. In the sudden
horror of the tragedy the big fellows had momentarily
forgotten their own grim epilogue.
Now, at the words, they turned toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
door. But the Swede was in advance, blocking
the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me first who did this thing,&#8221; he challenged,
threateningly.</p>
<p>A hand was laid gently upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asa Arnold, my boy,&#8221; answered a quiet
voice, which continued, in response to a sudden
thought, &#8220;You live near here; have you seen
him to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swede dropped the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little man who stays with Hans
Becher?&#8221;</p>
<p>The questioner nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a half-hour ago.&#8221; The boy-man understood
now. &#8220;He stopped at my house,
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which direction did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ole stepped outside, his arm stretched over
the prairie, white now in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way,&#8221; he indicated. &#8220;East.&#8221;</p>
<p>As there had been quiescence before, now
there was action. No charge of cavalry was
ever more swift than their sudden departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;East, toward Schooner&#8217;s ranch,&#8221; was called
and repeated as they made their way back to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
road; and, following, the wiry little bronchos
groaned in unison as the back cinch to each one
of the heavy saddles, was, with one accord,
drawn tight. Then, widening out upon the
reflected whiteness of prairie, there spread a
great black crescent. A moment later came
silence, broken only by the quivering call of a
lone coyote.</p>
<p>Ole watched them out of sight, then turned
back to the door; the mood of the heroic passed,
once more the timid, retiring Swede. But now
he was not alone. Bud Evans was quietly working
over the body on the floor, laying it out
decently as the quick ever lay out the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evans,&#8221; called the doctor from the bedroom.
As the agent responded, Ole heard the
smothered cry of a woman in pain.</p>
<p>The big boy hesitated, then sat down on the
doorstep. There was nothing now for him
to do, and suddenly he felt very tired. His
head dropped listlessly into his hands; like a
great dog, he waited, watching.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. On the table the oil lamp
sputtered and burned lower. Out in the stable
the horse repeated its former challenging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
whinny. Once again through the partition the
listener caught the choking wail of pain, and
the muffled sound of the doctor&#8217;s voice in
answer.</p>
<p>At last Bud Evans came to the door, his face
very white. &#8220;Water,&#8221; he requested, and Ole ran
to the well and back. Then, impassive, he sat
down again to wait.</p>
<p>Time passed, so long a time it seemed to the
watcher that the riders must soon be returning.
Finally Evans emerged from the side room,
walking absently, his face gray in the lamplight.</p>
<p>The Swede stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camilla Maurice, is she hurt?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The little agent busied himself making a fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he answered slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dead,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;very quietly.</p>
<p>The fire blazed up and lit the room, shining
unpityingly upon the face of the man on the
floor.</p>
<p>Evans noticed, and drawing off his own coat
spread it over the face and hands, covering them
from sight; then, uncertain, he returned and sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
down, mechanically holding his palms to the
blaze.</p>
<p>A moment later Dr. Curtis appeared at
the tiny bedroom entrance; and, emerging
as the little man had done before him, he closed
the door softly behind. In his arms he carried
a blanket, carefully rolled. From the depths of
its folds, as he slowly crossed the room toward
the stove, there escaped a sudden cry, muffled,
unmistakable.</p>
<p>The doctor sank down wearily in a chair.
Ole, the boy-faced, without a question brought
in fresh wood, laying it down on the floor very,
very softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he&ndash;&ndash;live?&#8221; asked Bud Evans, suddenly,
with an uncertain glance at the obscuring
blanket; and hearing the query, the Swede
paused in his work to listen.</p>
<p>The big doctor hesitated, and cleared his
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so; though&ndash;&ndash;God forgive me&ndash;&ndash;I
hope not.&#8221; And he cleared his throat again.</p>

<h2>JOURNEY&#8217;S END</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221; It was the girl who spoke, but
the man did not seem to hear. He was
staring through the window, unseeingly, into
the heart of his bitter foe, Winter. He sat silent,
helpless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221;</p>
<p>At last he awoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie!&ndash;&ndash;girlie!&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour had passed since he left the doctor&#8217;s
office to reel and stagger drunkenly through the
slush and the sleet, and the icy blasts, which bit
cruelly into his very vitals.</p>
<p>Now he and Mollie were alone in the tiny
library. Babcock had been warmed, washed,
fed. Seemingly without volition on his part,
he was before the hard-coal blaze, his feet on the
fender, the light carefully shaded from his eyes.
Once upon a time&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>But Steve Babcock, master mechanic, had
not lost his nerve&ndash;&ndash;once upon a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the voice was as soft as the wide
brown eyes, as the dainty oval chin&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Steve,
tell me what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s hand, palm outward, dropped
wearily, eloquently. That was all.</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me,&#8221; the girl&#8217;s chair came closer, so
that she might have touched him, &#8220;you went to
see the doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the silent, hopeless gesture, more fear-inspiring
than words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep me in suspense, please.&#8221; A
small hand was on the man&#8217;s knee, now, frankly
unashamed. &#8220;Tell me what he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant there was silence, then Babcock
shrugged awkwardly, in an effort at nonchalance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I was&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; in spite of himself,
the speaker paused to moisten his lips&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a
dead man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a word this time; not even a shrug.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Steve, you&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re not&ndash;&ndash;not joking with
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lower and lower, still in silence, dropped the
man&#8217;s chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; in a steadier voice, &#8220;please answer
me. You&#8217;re not joking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joking!&#8221; At last the query had pierced
the fear-dulled brain. &#8220;Joking! God, no!
It&#8217;s real, real, deadly real, that&#8217;s what ...
Oh, Mollie&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; Instinctively, as a child, the
man&#8217;s head had gone to the girl&#8217;s lap. Though
never before had they spoken of love or of marriage,
neither noted the incongruity now. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all over. We&#8217;ll never be married, never again
get out into the country together, never even see
the green grass next Spring&ndash;&ndash;at least I won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;never....
Oh, Mollie, Mollie!&#8221; The
man&#8217;s back rose and fell spasmodically. His
voice broke. &#8220;Mollie, make me forget; I can&#8217;t
bear to think of it. Can&#8217;t! Can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a muscle of the girl&#8217;s body stirred; she
made no sound. No one in advance would have
believed it possible, but it was true. Five minutes
passed. The man became quiet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Steve,&#8221; the voice was very even, &#8220;what else
did the doctor say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; It was the doddering query of an
old man.</p>
<p>The girl repeated the question, slowly, with
infinite patience, as though she were speaking
to a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else did the doctor say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tranquillity in a measure calmed the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he said a lot of things; but that&#8217;s all I
remember&ndash;&ndash;what I told you. It was the last
thing, and he kind of tilted back in his chair.
The spring needed oil; it fairly screamed. I
can hear it now.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Steve Babcock,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you&#8217;ve got to go
some place where it&#8217;s drier, where the air&#8217;s pure
and clean and sweet the year round. Mexico&#8217;s
the spot for you, or somewhere in the Far West
where you can spend all your time in the open&ndash;&ndash;under
the roof of Heaven.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He leaned forward, and again that cursed
spring interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you don&#8217;t go, and go right away,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;as sure as I&#8217;m talking to you, you&#8217;re a
dead man.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>Babcock straightened, and, leaden-eyed,
looked dully into the blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;were his last
words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you do go?&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;very quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I had a chance&ndash;&ndash;a fighting
chance.&#8221; Once more the hopeless, deprecatory
gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the use? You know, as well as
I, that I haven&#8217;t a hundred dollars to my name.
He might just as well have told me to go to the
moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We poor folks are like rats in a trap when
they turn the water on&ndash;&ndash;helpless. We&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Babcock had wandered on, forgetting, for
the moment, that it was his own case he was
analyzing. Now of a sudden it recurred to him,
cumulatively, crushingly and, as before, his
head instinctively sought refuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do anything but take our medicine,
Mollie&ndash;&ndash;just take our medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Patter</i>, <i>patter</i> sounded the sleet against the
window-panes, mingling with the roar of the
wind in the chimney, with the short, quick
breaths of the man. In silence he reached out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
took one of the girl&#8217;s hands captive, and held it
against his cheek.</p>
<p>For a minute&ndash;&ndash;five minutes&ndash;&ndash;she did not
stir, did not utter a sound; only the soft oval
face tightened until its gentle outlines grew
sharp, and the brown skin almost white.</p>
<p>All at once her lips compressed; she had
reached a decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve, sit up, please; I can talk to you better
so.&#8221; Pityingly, protectingly, she placed an
arm around him and drew him close; not as man
to maid, but&ndash;&ndash;ah, the pity of it!&ndash;&ndash;as a feeble
child to its mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to what I say. To-day is Thursday.
Next Monday you are going West, as the
doctor orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what did you say, Mollie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next Monday you go West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, after all, I&#8217;m to have a chance?
I&#8217;m not going to die like&ndash;&ndash;like a rat?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, a swiftly passing moment, it
was the old vital Steve who spoke; the Babcock
of a year ago; then, in quick recession, the mood
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
girl. I can&#8217;t go, I tell you. I haven&#8217;t the
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that you have the money, Steve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been teaching for eight years, and living
at home all the while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, surprised out of his self centredness,
looked wonderingly, unbelievingly, at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told me, Mollie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never saw the need before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s look of wonder passed. Another&ndash;&ndash;fearful,
dependent, the look of a child in the
dark&ndash;&ndash;took its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;alone, Mollie! A strange land, a
strange people, a strange tongue! Oh, I hate
myself, girl, hate myself! I&#8217;ve lost my nerve.
I can&#8217;t go alone. I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going alone, Steve.&#8221; There was
a triumphant note in her voice that thrilled the
man through and through. She continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Only this morning&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know why I
did it; it seems now like Providence pointing
the way&ndash;&ndash;I read in the paper about the rich
farm lands in South Dakota that are open for
settlement. I thought of you at the time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Steve; how such a life might restore your
health; but it seemed so impossible, so impracticable,
that I soon forgot about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;Steve&ndash;&ndash;we can each take up a
quarter-section&ndash;&ndash;three hundred and twenty
acres, altogether. Think of it! We&#8217;ll soon be
rich. There you will have just the sort of outdoor
life the doctor says you need.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her, marvelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t mean it&ndash;&ndash;now, when
I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;this way!&#8221; He arose, his breath coming
quick, a deep blot of red in the centre of
each cheek. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be true when&ndash;&ndash;when
you&#8217;d never let me say anything before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Steve, it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was so calm, so self-possessed and withal
so determined, that the man was incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;ll marry me? Say it, Mollie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie!&#8221; He took a step forward, then of
a sudden, abruptly halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But your parents,&#8221; in swift trepidation.
&#8220;Mollie, they&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s speak of them,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Then in quick contrition, her voice softened;
once more it struck the maternal note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, I&#8217;m very tired. Come. We
have a spare room; you mustn&#8217;t go home to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stopped, coughed, advanced a step,
then stopped again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, I can&#8217;t thank you; can&#8217;t ever repay
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk of repaying me,&#8221; she said
shyly, her dark face coloring. It was the first
time during the interview that she had shown a
trace of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said, meeting his look again, her
hand on the door; &#8220;it&#8217;s getting late. You must
not venture out.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment longer the man hesitated, then
obeyed. Not until he was very near, so near
that he could touch her, did a vestige of his
former manhood appear. He paused, and their
eyes were locked in a soul-searching look. Then
all at once his arm was round her waist, his face
beside her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, girl, won&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;just once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&ndash;&ndash;not that! Don&#8217;t ask it.&#8221; Passionately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the brown hands flew to the brown cheeks,
covering them protectingly. But at once came
thought, the spirit of sacrifice, and contrition
for the involuntary repulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Steve; I&#8217;m unaccountable to-night.&#8221;
Her voice, her manner were constrained,
subdued. She accepted his injured
look without comment, without further defence.
She saw the perplexed look on his thin face;
then she reached forward&ndash;&ndash;up&ndash;&ndash;and her two
soft hands brought his face down to the level of
her own.</p>
<p>Deliberately, voluntarily, she kissed him fair
upon the lips.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The sun was just peering over the rim of the
prairie, when Mrs. Warren turned in from the
dusty road, picked her way among the browning
weeds to the plain, unpainted, shanty-like
structure which marked the presence of a homesteader.
Except to the east, where stood the
tents and shacks of the new railroad&#8217;s construction
gang, not another human habitation broke
the dull, monotonous rolling sea of prairie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Warren pounded vigorously upon the
rough boards of the door.</p>
<p>A full half-minute she waited; then she
glared petulantly at the unresponsive barrier,
and pounded upon it again.</p>
<p>Ordinarily she would have waited patiently,
for the multitude of duties of one day often
found Mrs. Babcock still weary with the dawning
of the next&ndash;&ndash;especially since Steve had
allied himself with Jack Warren&#8217;s engineering
corps.</p>
<p>Funds had run low, and the two valetudinarians
had reached the stage of desperation where
they were driven to acknowledge failure, when
Jack Warren happened along, in the van of
the new railroad.</p>
<p>The work of home-building, from the raw
material, had been too much for Steve&#8217;s enfeebled
physique; so it happened that Mollie
performed most of his share, as well as all of
her own. Yet Steve toiled to the limit of his
endurance, and each day, at sundown, flung
himself upon his blanket, spread beneath the
stars, dog-tired, fairly trembling with weariness.
But he soon developed a prodigious appetite,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
and, after the first few weeks, slept each
night like a dead man, until sunrise.</p>
<p>This morning Annie Warren was too full of
her errand to pause an instant. She stood a
moment listening, one ear to the splintery,
unfinished boards, then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; she ventured, &#8220;are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;more insistent, &#8220;wake up and let
me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; for the third time, &#8220;it is I, Annie;
may I enter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221; The voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>Within the uncomfortably low, dim room the
visitor impetuously crossed the earthen floor
half-way to a rude bunk built against the wall,
then paused, her round, childlike face soberly
lengthening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, you have been crying!&#8221; she charged,
resentfully, as if the act constituted a personal
offence. &#8220;You can&#8217;t deceive me. The pillow is
soaked, and your eyes are red.&#8221; She came forward,
impulsively, and threw herself on the bed,
her arm about the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? Tell me&ndash;&ndash;your friend&ndash;&ndash;Annie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beneath the light coverlet, Mollie Babcock
made a motion of deprecation, almost of repugnance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing. Please don&#8217;t pay any attention
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it <i>is</i> something. Am I not your
friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment neither spoke. Annie Warren
all at once became conscious that the other
woman was looking at her in a way she had
never done before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuredly you are my friend, Annie. But
just the same, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221; The look altered
until it became a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, instead, why you are here,&#8221; Mollie
went on. &#8220;It is not usual at this time of day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Annie Warren felt the rebuff, and she was
hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing.&#8221; The visitor was on her feet,
her voice again resentful; her chin was held
high, while her long lashes drooped. &#8220;Pardon
me for intruding, for&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Annie!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>No answer save the quiver of a sensitive red
lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Annie, child, pardon me. I wouldn&#8217;t for
the world hurt you; but it is so hard, what you
ask.&#8221; Mollie Babcock rose, now, likewise.
&#8220;However, if you wish&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; The storm was clearing. &#8220;It
was all my fault. I know you&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;
She had grasped Mollie&#8217;s arms, and was forcing
her backward, toward the bunk, gently,
smilingly. &#8220;Be still. I&#8217;ve something to tell
you. Are you quite ready to listen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m quite ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t the slightest idea what it is?
You couldn&#8217;t even guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t even guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, then.&#8221; The plump Annie was
bubbling like a child before a well-filled Christmas
stocking. &#8220;It&#8217;s Jack: he&#8217;s coming this
very day. A big, fierce Indian brought the
letter this morning.&#8221; She sat down tailor fashion
on the end of the bunk. &#8220;He nearly ate up
Susie&ndash;&ndash;Jack christened her Susie because she&#8217;s
a Sioux&ndash;&ndash;because she wouldn&#8217;t let him put the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
letter right into my own hand. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m
up so early.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked slyly at the woman on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose is coming with him?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; in a tone of not
caring, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess, Mollie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&ndash;&ndash;Steve. You knew all the time,
only you wouldn&#8217;t admit it. Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!
I want to hug some one. Isn&#8217;t it fine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, fine indeed. But you don&#8217;t mean that
you want to hug Steve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, goose. You know I meant Jack; but
I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She regarded her friend doubtfully.
But Mollie Babcock was dressing rapidly, and
her face was averted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mollie, I didn&#8217;t tell you all&ndash;&ndash;almost
the best. We&#8217;re going home, Jack says; going
right away; this very week, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the dressing halted. &#8220;I am
very glad&ndash;&ndash;for you,&#8221; said Mollie, in an even
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad, for me!&#8221; mimickingly, baitingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
&#8220;Mollie Babcock, if I didn&#8217;t know you better,
I&#8217;d say you were envious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mollie said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or weren&#8217;t glad your husband is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still no word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;Mollie, what have I done?&#8221;
Annie cried in dismay. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry so; I was
only joking. Of course you know that I didn&#8217;t
mean that you envied our good luck, or that
you wouldn&#8217;t be crazy to see Steve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so. God help me, it&#8217;s so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie!&#8221; Mrs. Warren was aghast. &#8220;Forgive
me! I&#8217;m ashamed of myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to forgive; it&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t.&#8221; The two were very close,
very tense, but not touching. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say any
more. I didn&#8217;t hear&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did hear. And you suspected, or you
wouldn&#8217;t have suggested!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, I never dreamed. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of a sudden the older woman faced about.
Seizing the other by the shoulders, she held her
prisoner. She fixed the frightened woman&#8217;s
eyes with a stern look.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you swear that you never knew&ndash;&ndash;that
it was mere chance&ndash;&ndash;what you said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You swear you didn&#8217;t?&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the grip tightened&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you
swear it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear&ndash;&ndash;oh, you&#8217;re hurting me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mollie Babcock let her hands drop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;wearily. &#8220;It seemed that
everybody knew. God help me!&#8221; She sank to
the bed, her face in her hands. &#8220;I believe I&#8217;m
going mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie&ndash;&ndash;Mollie Babcock! You mustn&#8217;t
talk so&ndash;&ndash;you mustn&#8217;t!&#8221; The seconds ticked
away. Save for the quick catch of suppressed
sobs, not a sound was heard in the mean, austere
little room; not an echo penetrated from the
outside world.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the brown head lifted from
the pillow, and Mollie faced almost fiercely
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I am&ndash;&ndash;am mad already.&#8221; Then,
feverishly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helpless at a crisis, Annie Warren could only
stand silent, the pink, childish under-lip held
tight between her teeth to prevent a quiver.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Her fingers played nervously with the filmy
lace shawl about her shoulders.</p>
<p>Mollie advanced a step. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Annie found her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no! Oh, Mollie, no, of course
not! You&ndash;&ndash;Mollie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Instinct all at once
came to her rescue. With a sudden movement
she gathered the woman in her arms, her tender
heart quivering in her voice and glistening in
her eyes. &#8220;Mollie, I can&#8217;t bear to have you so!
I love you, Mollie. Tell me what it is&ndash;&ndash;me&ndash;&ndash;your
friend, Annie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mollie&#8217;s lips worked without speech, and
Annie became insistent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Mollie. Let me share the ache at
your heart. I love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was the crushing straw to one very, very
heartsick and very weary. For the first time
in her solitary life, Mollie Babcock threw reticence
to the winds, and admitted another human
being into the secret places of her confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t think me already mad, you will
before I&#8217;m through.&#8221; Like a caged wild thing
that can not be still, she was once more on her
feet, vibrating back and forth like a shuttle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of myself at times, afraid of the
future. It&#8217;s like the garret used to be after
dark, when we were children: it holds only
horrors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, child!&#8221; She paused, her arms
folded across her breast, her throat a-throb.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t understand&ndash;&ndash;thank God, you
never will understand&ndash;&ndash;what the future holds
for me. You are going back home; back to your
own people, your own life. You&#8217;ve been here
but a few months. To you it has been a lark,
an outing, an experience. In a few short weeks
it will be but a memory, stowed away in its own
niche, the pleasant features alone remaining
vivid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even, while here, you&#8217;ve never known the
life itself. You&#8217;ve had Jack, the novelty of a
strange environment, your anticipation of sure
release. You are merely like a sightseer, locked
for a minute in a prison-cell, for the sake of a
new sensation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t understand, I say. You are this,
and I&ndash;&ndash;I am the life-prisoner in the cell beyond,
peering at you through the bars, viewing
you and your mock imprisonment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>Once more the speaker was in motion, to and
fro, to and fro, in the shuttle-trail. &#8220;The chief
difference is, that the life-prisoner has a hope
of pardon; I have none&ndash;&ndash;absolutely none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;pleadingly, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll
ask Jack to give Steve a place at home, and you
can go&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; The bitterness of her heart welled
up and vibrated in the word. &#8220;Go! We can&#8217;t
go, now or ever. It&#8217;s death to Steve if we
leave. I&#8217;ve got to stay here, month after month,
year after year, dragging my life out until I
grow gray-haired&ndash;&ndash;until I die!&#8221; She halted,
her arms tensely folded, her breath coming
quick. Only the intensity of her emotion saved
the attitude from being histrionic. In a sudden
outburst, she fiercely apostrophized:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dakota! I hate you, I hate you! Because
I am a woman, I hate you! Because I
would live in a house, and not in this endless
dreary waste of a dead world, I hate you! Because
your very emptiness and solitude are worse
than a prison, because the calls of the living
things that creep and fly over your endless
bosom are more mournful than death itself, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
hate you! Because I would be free, because I
respect sex, because of the disdain for womanhood
that dwells in your crushing silence, I
hate&ndash;&ndash;oh, my God, how I hate you!&#8221; She
threw her arms wide, in a frantic gesture of
rebellion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want but this,&#8221; she cried passionately:
&#8220;to be free; free, as I was at home, in God&#8217;s
country. And I can never be so here&ndash;&ndash;never,
never, never! Oh, Annie, I&#8217;m homesick&ndash;&ndash;desperately,
miserably homesick! I wish to
Heaven I were dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Annie Warren, child-woman that she was,
was helpless, when face to face with the unusual.
Her senses were numbed, paralyzed.
One thought alone suggested itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;haltingly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;for Steve&#8217;s sake&ndash;&ndash;certainly,
for him&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! As you love me, stop!&#8221; Again no
suggestion of the histrionic in the passionate
voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that now. I can&#8217;t stand it.
I&ndash;&ndash;oh, I don&#8217;t mean that! Forget that I said
it. I&#8217;m not responsible this morning. Please
leave me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>She was prostrate on the bed at last, her whole
body a-tremble.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;Mollie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go&ndash;&ndash;go!&#8221; cried Mollie, wildly. &#8220;Please
go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Awed to silence, Annie Warren stared helplessly
a moment, then gathered her shawl about
her shoulders, and slipped silently away.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Mollie Babcock was listlessly going about
some imperative domestic task, behind the mean
structure which represented home for her, when
Steve came upon her.</p>
<p>She was not looking for him. He had been
gone so long, out there somewhere, in that abomination
of desolation, building a railroad, that
the morbid fancy had come to dwell with her
that the prairie had swallowed him, and that
she would never see him more. So he came upon
her unawares.</p>
<p>The buffalo grass rustled with the passage of
her skirts. His eyes lighted, the man seemed
to grow in stature&ndash;&ndash;six feet of sun-blessed,
primitive health. Now was the time&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sudden gasp from the woman.
With a hand to her throat, she wheeled swiftly
round, confronting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back at last. Aren&#8217;t you glad to see
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was as pallid as an Easter-lily; pallid,
despite the fact that she had decided, and had
nerved herself for his coming.</p>
<p>Steve was puzzled. &#8220;Mollie, girl&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he did
not advance, merely stood as he was&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;aren&#8217;t
you glad to see me? Won&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;come?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long space of silence; the woman
did not stir. Then a strange, inarticulate cry
was smothered in her throat. Swiftly, all but
desperately, she stumbled blindly forward, although
her eyes were shining with the enchantment
of his presence; close to him she came,
flung her arms around his broad chest, and
strained him to her with the abandon of a wild
creature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve!&#8221; tensely, &#8220;how could you? Glad?
You know I&#8217;m glad&ndash;&ndash;oh, so glad! You
startled me, that was all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, girlie&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he lifted her at arms&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
length, joying in this testimony of his renewed
strength and manhood&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I rode all last night
to get here&ndash;&ndash;to see you. Are you happy, girlie,
happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Steve&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;her voice was chastened to
a murmur&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That completes my happiness.&#8221; Drawing
her tenderly to him, he kissed her again and
again&ndash;&ndash;hungrily, passionately; then, abruptly,
he fell to scrutinizing her, with a meaning that
she was quick to interpret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there something you&#8217;ve forgotten,
Mollie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve not forgotten, Steve.&#8221; She drew
the bearded face down to her own. Had Steve
been observant he would have noticed that the
lips so near his own were trembling; but he was
not observant, this Steve Babcock. Once, twice
and again she kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll never forget, Steve, man&ndash;&ndash;never!&#8221;
With one hand she indicated the
prairie that billowed away to the skyline. &#8220;This
is our home, and I love it because it is ours. I
shall always have you&ndash;&ndash;I know now, Steve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
And I&#8217;m the happiest, most contented woman
in all the wide world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew away with a sudden movement, her
face aglow with love and happiness. She was
pulling at his arm with all her might.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over to the camp&ndash;&ndash;to Journey&#8217;s End. I
must tell Annie Warren just as soon as ever
I can find her.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A PRAIRIE IDYL</h2>
</div>
<p>A beautiful moonlight night early
in September, the kind of night one remembers
for years, when the air is not too
cold to be pleasant, and yet has a suggestion of
the frost that is to come. A kind of air that
makes one think thoughts which cannot be put
into words, that calls up sensations one cannot
describe; an air which breeds restless energy;
an air through which Mother Nature seems to
speak, saying&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Hasten, children; life is
short and you have much to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearing ten o&#8217;clock, and a full moon
lit up the rolling prairie country of South Dakota
for miles, when the first team of a little
train of six moved slowly out of the dark
shadow blots thrown by the trees at the edge of
the Big Sioux, advancing along a dim trail
towards the main road. From the first wagon
sounded the suggestive rattle of tin cooking-utensils,
and the clatter of covers on an old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
cook stove. Next behind was a load piled high
with a compound heap of tents, tennis nets, old
carpets, hammocks, and the manifold unclassified
paraphernalia which twenty young people
will collect for a three weeks&#8217; outing.</p>
<p>These wagons told their own story. &#8220;Camp
Eden,&#8221; the fanciful name given to the quiet,
shady spot where the low chain of hills met the
river; the spot where the very waters seemed to
lose themselves in their own cool depths, and
depart sighing through the shallows beyond,&ndash;&ndash;Camp
Eden was deserted, and a score of very
tired campers were reluctantly returning to
home and work.</p>
<p>Last in the line and steadily losing ground,
came a single trap carrying two people. One
of them, a young man with the face of a
dreamer, was speaking. The spell of the night
was upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is the last of our good time&ndash;&ndash;and
now for work.&#8221; He stopped the horse and
stood up in the wagon. &#8220;Good-bye, little Camp
Eden. Though I won&#8217;t be here, yet whenever
I see the moon a-shining so&ndash;&ndash;and the air feeling
frosty and warm and restless&ndash;&ndash;and the corn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
stalks whitening, and the young prairie chickens
calling&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll come back to me, and I&#8217;ll
think of you&ndash;&ndash;and of the Big Sioux&ndash;&ndash;and of&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
His eyes dropped to a smooth brown head,
every coil of the walnut hair glistening.</p>
<p>It made him think of the many boat rides
they two had taken together in the past two
weeks, when he had watched the moonlight
shimmering on rippling, running water, and
compared the play of light upon it and upon
that same brown head&ndash;&ndash;and had forgotten all
else in the comparison. He forgot all else now.
He sat down, and the horse started. The noisy
wagons ahead had passed out of hearing. The
pair were alone.</p>
<p>He was silent a moment, looking sideways at
the girl. The moonlight fell full upon her face,
drawing clear the line of cheek and chin; bringing
out the curve of the drooping mouth and the
shadow from the long lashes. She seemed to
the sensitive lad more than human. He had
loved her for years, with the pure silent love
known only to such a nature as his&ndash;&ndash;and never
had he loved her so wildly as now.</p>
<p>He was the sport of a multitude of passions;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
love and ambition were the strongest, and they
were fighting a death struggle with each other.
How could he leave her for years&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
never see her again&ndash;&ndash;and yet how could he
ask her to be the wife of such as he was now&ndash;&ndash;a
mere laborer? And again, his college course,
his cherished ambition for years&ndash;&ndash;how could he
give it up; and yet he felt&ndash;&ndash;he knew she loved
him, and trusted him.</p>
<p>He had been looking squarely at her. She
turned, and their eyes met. Each knew the
thought of the other, and each turned away.
He hesitated no longer; he would tell her all,
and she should judge. His voice trembled a
little as he said: &#8220;I want to tell you a story,
and ask you a question&ndash;&ndash;may I?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him quickly, then answered
with a smile: &#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to hear stories&ndash;&ndash;and
at the worst one can always decline to
answer questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked out over the prairie, and saw the
lights of the little town&ndash;&ndash;her home&ndash;&ndash;in the
distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a short story, and I have only so
long&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he pointed along the road ahead to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
village beyond&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;to tell it in.&#8221; He settled
back in the seat, and began speaking. His
voice was low and soft, like the prairie night-wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the story you know; part of it I
think you have guessed; a little of it will be
new. For the sake of that little, I will tell
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirteen years ago, what is now a little
prairie town&ndash;&ndash;then a very little town indeed&ndash;&ndash;gained
a new citizen&ndash;&ndash;a boy of nine. A
party of farmers found him one day, sleeping
in a pile of hay, in the market corner. He lay
so they could see how his face was bruised&ndash;&ndash;and
how, though asleep, he tossed in pain. He
awoke, and, getting up, walked with a limp.
Where he came from no one knew, and he would
not tell; but his appearance told its own story.
He had run away from somewhere. What had
happened they could easily imagine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was harvest-time and boys, even though
minus a pedigree, were in demand; so he was
promptly put on a farm. Though only a child,
he had no one to care for him&ndash;&ndash;and he was
made to work ceaselessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Years passed and brought a marked change
in the boy. How he lived was a marvel. It was
a country of large families, and no one cared
to adopt him. Summers, he would work for his
board and clothes, and in winter, by the irony
of Nature, for his board only; yet, perhaps because
it was the warmest place he knew, he
managed to attend district school.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a lad of fifteen he began to receive
wages&ndash;&ndash;and life&#8217;s horizon seemed to change.
He dressed neatly, and in winter came to
school in the little prairie town. He was put in
the lower grades with boys of ten, and even
here his blunders made him a laughing-stock;
but not for long, for he worked&ndash;&ndash;worked always&ndash;&ndash;and
next year was put in the high
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he established a precedent&ndash;&ndash;doing
four years&#8217; work in two&ndash;&ndash;and graduated at
eighteen. How he did it no one but he himself
knew&ndash;&ndash;studying Sundays, holidays, and evenings,
when he was so tired that he had to walk
the floor to keep awake&ndash;&ndash;but he did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker stopped a moment to look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
his companion. &#8220;Is this a bore? Somehow I
can&#8217;t help talking to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, please go on,&#8221; said the girl quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the boy graduated&ndash;&ndash;but not alone.
For two years he had worked side by side with
a brown-haired, brown-eyed girl. From the
time he had first seen her she was his ideal&ndash;&ndash;his
divinity. And she had never spoken with him
five minutes in her life. After graduation, the
girl went away to a big university. Her parents
were wealthy, and her every wish was
gratified.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the speaker hesitated. When he went
on his face was hard, his voice bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the boy&ndash;&ndash;he was poor and he went
back to the farm. He was the best hand in the
country; for the work he received good wages.
If he had worked hard before, he worked now
like a demon. He thought of the girl away at
college, and tried at first to crowd her from his
memory&ndash;&ndash;but in vain. Then he worked in
self-defence&ndash;&ndash;and to forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw years slipping by&ndash;&ndash;and himself
still a farmhand. The thought maddened him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
because he knew he was worthy of something
better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gradually, his whole life centred upon one
object&ndash;&ndash;to save money for college. Other boys
called him close and cold; but he did not care.
He seldom went anywhere, so intent was he
upon his one object. On hot summer nights,
tired and drowsy he would read until Nature rebelled,
and he would fall asleep to dream of a
girl&ndash;&ndash;a girl with brown eyes that made one forget&ndash;&ndash;everything.
In winter, he had more time&ndash;&ndash;and
the little lamp in his room became a sort
of landmark: it burned for hours after every
other light in the valley had ceased shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four years passed, and at last the boy had
won. In a month he would pass from the
prairie to university life. He had no home, few
friends&ndash;&ndash;who spoke; those who did not were
safely packed at the bottom of his trunk. His
going from the little town would excite no more
comment than had his coming. He was all
ready, and for the first time in his life set apart
a month&ndash;&ndash;the last&ndash;&ndash;as a vacation. He
felt positively gay. He had fought a hard fight&ndash;&ndash;and
had won. He saw the dawning of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
great light&ndash;&ndash;saw the future as a battle-ground
where he would fight; not as he was then, but
fully equipped for the struggle.... But
no matter what air-castles he built; they were
such as young men will build to the end of
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s voice lowered&ndash;&ndash;stopped. He
looked straight out over the prairie, his eyes
glistening.</p>
<p>&#8220;If so far the boy&#8217;s life had been an inferno,
he was to be repaid. The girl&ndash;&ndash;she of the
brown eyes&ndash;&ndash;was home once more, and they
met again as members of a camping party.&#8221;
He half-turned in his seat to look at her, but
she sat with face averted, so quiet, so motionless,
that he wondered if she heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you listening?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listening!&#8221; Her voice carried conviction,
so the lad continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a fortnight he lived a dream&ndash;&ndash;and
that dream was Paradise. He forgot the past,
ignored the future, and lived solely for the
moment&ndash;&ndash;with the joy of Nature&#8217;s own child.
It was the pure love of the idealist and the
dreamer&ndash;&ndash;it was divine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then came the reaction. One day he awoke&ndash;&ndash;saw
things as they were&ndash;&ndash;saw again the
satire of Fate. At the very time he left for college,
she returned&ndash;&ndash;a graduate. She was
young, beautiful, accomplished. He was a
mere farmhand, without money or education,
homeless, obscure. The thought was maddening,
and one day he suddenly disappeared from
camp. He didn&#8217;t say good-bye to any one; he
felt he had no apology that he could offer. But
he had to go, for he felt the necessity for work,
longed for it, as a drunkard longs for liquor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The exclamation came from the
lips of the girl beside him. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;all
wondered why&ndash;&ndash;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was why.</p>
<p>&#8220;He fell in with a threshing-crew, and asked
to work for his board. They thought him queer,
but accepted his offer. For two days he stayed
with them, doing the work of two men. It
seemed as if he couldn&#8217;t do enough&ndash;&ndash;he
couldn&#8217;t become tired. He wanted to think it
all out, and he couldn&#8217;t with the fever in his
blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;At night he couldn&#8217;t sleep&ndash;&ndash;Nature was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
pitiless. He would walk the road for miles
until morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the third day came relief. All at once
he felt fearfully tired, and fell asleep where he
stood. Several of the crew carried him to a
darkened room, and there he slept as a dumb
animal sleeps. When he awoke, he was himself
again; his mind was clear and cool. He looked
the future squarely in the face, now, and
clearly, as if a finger pointed, he saw the path
that was marked for him. He must go his way&ndash;&ndash;and
she must go hers. Perhaps, after four
years or more&ndash;&ndash;but the future was God&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy paused. The lights of the town
were nearing, now; but he still looked out over
the moon-kissed prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest you know. The dreamer returned.
The party scarcely knew him, for he seemed
years older. There were but a few days more
of camp life, and he spent most of the time with
the girl. Like a malefactor out on bail, he was
painting a picture for the future. He thought
he had conquered himself&ndash;&ndash;but he hadn&#8217;t. It
was the same old struggle. Was not love more
than ambition or wealth? Had he not earned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
the right to speak? But something held him
back. If justice to himself, was it justice to the
girl? Conscience said &#8216;No.&#8217; It was hard&ndash;&ndash;no
one knows how hard&ndash;&ndash;but he said nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he turned to his companion, in his
voice the tenderness of a life-long passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the story: did the boy do right?&#8221;
A life&#8217;s work&ndash;&ndash;greater than a life itself, hung
on the answer to that question.</p>
<p>The girl understood it all. She had always
known that she liked him; but now&ndash;&ndash;now&ndash;&ndash;As
he had told his story, she had felt, first, pity,
and then something else; something incomparably
sweeter; something that made her heart
beat wildly, that seemed almost to choke her
with its ecstasy.</p>
<p>He loved her&ndash;&ndash;had loved her all these years!
He belonged to her&ndash;&ndash;and his future lay in her
hands.</p>
<p>His future! The thought fell upon her new-found
happiness with the suddenness of a blow.
She could keep him, but had she the right to do
so? She saw in him something that he did not
suspect&ndash;&ndash;and that something was genius. She
knew he had the ability to make for himself a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
name that would stand among the great names
of the earth.</p>
<p>Then, did his life really belong to her? Did
it not rather belong to himself and to the world?</p>
<p>She experienced a struggle, fierce as he himself
had fought. And the boy sat silent, tense,
waiting for her answer.</p>
<p>Yes, she must give him up; she would be
brave. She started to speak, but the words
would not come. Suddenly she buried her face
in her hands, while the glistening brown head
trembled with her sobs.</p>
<p>It was the last drop to the cup overflowing.
A second, and then, his arms were around her.
The touch was electrifying&ndash;&ndash;it was oblivion&ndash;&ndash;it
was heaven&ndash;&ndash;it was&ndash;&ndash;but only a young lover
knows what.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have answered,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;God
forgive me&ndash;&ndash;but I can&#8217;t go away now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus Fate sported with two lives.</p>

<h2>THE MADNESS OF WHISTLING WINGS</h2>
</div>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter I&ndash;&ndash;Sandford the Exemplary</span></h3>
<p>Ordinarily Sandford is sane&ndash;&ndash;undeniably
so. Barring the seventh, upon
any other day of the week, fifty-one weeks in
the year, from nine o&#8217;clock in the morning until
six at night&ndash;&ndash;omitting again a scant half-hour
at noon for lunch&ndash;&ndash;he may be found in his
tight little box of an office on the fifth floor of
the Exchange Building, at the corner of Main
Avenue and Thirteenth Street, where the elevated
makes its loop.</p>
<p>No dog chained beside his kennel is more
invariably present, no caged songster more incontestably
anchored. If you need his services,
you have but to seek his address between the
hours mentioned. You may do so with the
same assurance of finding him on duty that you
would feel, if you left a jug of water out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
doors over night in a blizzard, that the jug, as
a jug, would be no longer of value in the morning.
He was, and is, routine impersonate, exponent
of sound business personified; a living
sermon against sloth and improvidence, and
easy derelictions of the flesh.</p>
<p>That is to say, he is such fifty-one weeks out
of the fifty-two. All through the frigid winter
season, despite the lure of California limiteds or
Havana liners, he holds hard in that den of his,
with its floor and walls of sanitary tiling and
its ceiling of white enamel, and hews&ndash;&ndash;or
grinds rather, for Sandford is a dental surgeon&ndash;&ndash;close
to the line.</p>
<p>All through the heat of summer, doggedly
superior to the call of Colorado or the Adirondacks
or the Thousand Islands, he comes and
departs by the tick of the clock. Base-ball
fans find him adamant; turf devotees, marble;
golf enthusiasts, cold as the tiles beneath his
feet.</p>
<p>Even in early June, when Dalton, whose
suburban home is next door, returns, tanned
and clear-eyed from a week-end at <i>the</i> lake&ndash;&ndash;there
is but one lake to Dalton&ndash;&ndash;and calls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
him mysteriously back to the rear of the house,
where, with a flourish, the cover is removed
from a box the expressman has just delivered,
to disclose a shining five-pound bass reposing
upon its bed of packed ice&ndash;&ndash;even then, hands
in pockets, Sandford merely surveys and expresses
polite congratulation. Certainly it
is a fine fish, a noble fish, even; but for the sake
of one like it&ndash;&ndash;or, yes, granted a dozen such&ndash;&ndash;to
leave the office, the sanitary-tiled office, deserted
for four whole days (especially when Dr.
Corliss on the floor below is watching like a
hawk)&ndash;&ndash;such a crazy proceeding is not to be
thought of.</p>
<p>Certainly he will not go along the next week
end&ndash;&ndash;or the next, either. The suggestion
simply is unthinkable. Such digressions may be
all right for the leisure class or for invalids;
but for adults, live ones, strong and playing the
game? A shrug and a tolerant smile end the
discussion, as, hands still in his pockets, an
after-dinner cigar firm between his teeth, Sandford
saunters back across the dozen feet of sod
separating his own domicile from that of his
fallen and misguided neighbor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dalton&#8217;s got the fever again, bad,&#8221; he comments
to the little woman upon his own domain,
whom he calls &#8220;Polly,&#8221; or &#8220;Mrs. Sandford,&#8221;
as occasion dictates. She has been watching the
preceding incident with inscrutable eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Polly acknowledges, with the air
of harkening to a familiar harangue while casting
ahead, in anticipation of what was to come
next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curious about Dalton; peculiar twist to his
mental machinery somewhere.&#8221; Sandford
blows a cloud of smoke and eyes it meditatively.
&#8220;Leaving business that way, chopping it all to
pieces in fact; and just for a fish! Curious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s got something back there that&#8217;ll
probably interest you,&#8221; he calls out to me as I
chug by in my last year&#8217;s motor; &#8220;better stop
and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I acknowledge simply; and though
Polly&#8217;s eyes and mine meet we never smile, or
twitch an eyelid, or turn a hair; for Sandford
is observing&ndash;&ndash;and this is only June.</p>
<p>So much for Dr. Jekyll Sandford, the Sandford
of fifty-one weeks in the year.</p>
<p>Then, as inevitably as time rolls by, comes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
that final week; period of mania, of abandon;
and in the mere sorcerous passage of a pair of
whirring wings, Dr. Jekyll, the exemplary, is
no more. In his place, wearing his shoes, audaciously
signing his name even to checks, is
that other being, Hyde: one absolutely the reverse
of the reputable Jekyll; repudiating with
scorn that gentleman&#8217;s engagements; with
brazen effrontery denying him utterly, and all
the sane conventionality for which the name has
become a synonyme.</p>
<p>Worst of all, rank blasphemy, he not only refuses
to set foot in that modern sanitary office
of enamel and tiling, at the corner of Thirteenth
and Main, below which, by day and by
night, the &#8220;L&#8221; trains go thundering, but
deliberately holds it up to ridicule and derision
and insult.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter II&ndash;&ndash;The Presage of the Wings</span></h3>
<p>And I, the observer&ndash;&ndash;worse, the accessory&ndash;&ndash;know,
in advance, when the metamorphosis
will transpire.</p>
<p>When, on my desk-pad calendar the month
recorded is October, and the day begins with a
twenty, there comes the first premonition of
winter; not the reality, but a premonition;
when, at noon the sun is burning hot, and, in the
morning, frost glistens on the pavements; when
the leaves are falling steadily in the parks, and
not a bird save the ubiquitous sparrow is seen,
I begin to suspect.</p>
<p>But when at last, of an afternoon, the wind
switches with a great flurry from south to
dead north, and on the flag-pole atop of the
government building there goes up this signal:
<img alt='signal flag' src='images/illus-emb.png' />;
and when later, just before retiring, I surreptitiously
slip out of doors, and, listening
breathlessly, hear after a moment despite the
clatter of the wind, high up in the darkness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
overhead that muffled <i>honk!</i> <i>honk!</i> <i>honk!</i> of
the Canada-goose winging on its southern
journey in advance of the coming storm&ndash;&ndash;then
I <i>know</i>.</p>
<p>So well do I know, that I do not retire&ndash;&ndash;not
just yet. Instead, on a pretext, any pretext, I
knock out the ashes from my old pipe, fill it
afresh, and wait. I wait patiently, because, inevitable
as Fate, inevitable as that call from out
the dark void of the sky, I know there will come
a trill of the telephone on the desk at my elbow;
my own Polly&ndash;&ndash;whose name happens to be
Mary&ndash;&ndash;is watching as I take down the receiver
to reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter III&ndash;&ndash;The Other Man</span></h3>
<p>It is useless to dissimulate longer, then. I
am discovered, and I know I am discovered.
&#8220;Hello, Sandford,&#8221; I greet without preface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandford!&#8221; (I am repeating in whispers
what he says for my Polly&#8217;s benefit.) &#8220;Sandford!
How the deuce did you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know?&#8221; With the Hyde-like change
comes another, and I feel positively facetious.
&#8220;Why I know your ring of course, the same as
I know your handwriting on a telegram. What
is it? I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m busy, too. Don&#8217;t swell up.&#8221; (Imagine
&#8220;swell up&#8221; from Sandford, the repressed and
decorous!) &#8220;I just wanted to tell you that
the honkers are coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! You&#8217;re imagining, or you dreamed
it!... Anyway, what of it? I tell
you I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out!&#8221; I&#8217;m almost scared myself,
the voice is positively ferocious. &#8220;I heard them
not five minutes ago, and besides, the storm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
signal is up. I&#8217;m getting my traps together
now. Our train goes at three-ten in the morning,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our-train-goes-at-three-ten&ndash;&ndash;in-the-morning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Our</i> train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our train: the one which is to take us out
to Rush Lake. Am I clear? I&#8217;ll wire Johnson
to meet us with the buckboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear, yes; but go in the morning&ndash;&ndash;Why,
man, you&#8217;re crazy! I have engagements for
all day to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole week with me. What of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it! Why, business&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound business! I tell you they&#8217;re
coming; I heard them. I haven&#8217;t any more
time to waste talking, either. I&#8217;ve got to get
ready. Meet you at three-ten, remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Number, please,&#8221; requests Central, wearily.

<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter IV&ndash;&ndash;Capitulation</span></h3>
<p>Thus it comes to pass that I go; as I
know from the first I shall go, and Sandford
knows that I will go; and, most of all, as
Mary knows that I will go.</p>
<p>In fact, she is packing for me already; not
saying a word, but simply packing; and I&ndash;&ndash;I
go out-doors again, sidling into a jog beside the
bow-window, to diminish the din of the wind in
my ears, listening open-mouthed until&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Yes, there it sounds again; faint, but distinct;
mellow, sonorous, vibrant. <i>Honk!</i> <i>honk!</i> <i>honk!</i>
and again <i>honk!</i> <i>honk!</i> <i>honk!</i> It wafts downward
from some place, up above where the stars
should be and are not; up above the artificial illumination
of the city; up where there are freedom,
and space infinite, and abandon absolute.</p>
<p>With an effort, I force myself back into the
house. I take down and oil my old double-barrel,
lovingly, and try the locks to see that
all is in order. I lay out my wrinkled and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
battered duck suit handy for the morning, after
carefully storing away in an inner pocket,
where they will keep dry, the bundle of postcards
Mary brings me&ndash;&ndash;first exacting a promise
to report on one each day, when I know I
shall be five miles from the nearest postoffice,
and that I shall bring them all back unused.</p>
<p>And, last of all, I slip to bed, and to dreams
of gigantic honkers serene in the blue above;
of whirring, whistling wings that cut the air
like myriad knife blades; until I wake up with
a start at the rattle of the telephone beside my
bed, and I know that, though dark as a pit of
pitch, it is morning, and that Sandford is already
astir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter V&ndash;&ndash;Anticipation</span></h3>
<p>In the smoking-car forward I find Sandford.
He is a most disreputable-looking
specimen. Garbed in weather-stained corduroys,
and dried-grass sweater, and great calfskin
boots, he sprawls among gun-cases and
shell-carriers&ndash;&ndash;no sportsman will entrust these
essentials to the questionable ministrations of a
baggage-man&ndash;&ndash;and the air about him is blue
from the big cigar he is puffing so ecstatically.
He nods and proffers me its mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to be a great day,&#8221; he announces
succinctly, and despite a rigorous censorship
there is a suggestion of excitement in the voice.
&#8220;The wind&#8217;s dead north, and it&#8217;s cloudy and
damp. Rain, maybe, about daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; I am lighting up stolidly, although
my nerves are atingle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to hit it right, just right. The
flight&#8217;s on. I heard them going over all night.
The lake will be black with the big fellows, the
Canada boys.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I repeat; then conscience gives a
last dig. &#8220;I ought not to do it, though. I
didn&#8217;t have time to break a single engagement&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
a dental surgeon, too, by the way,
with likewise an office of tile and enamel&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;or
explain at all. And the muss there&#8217;ll be at the
shop when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, you confounded old dollar-grubber!&#8221;
A fresh torrent of smoke belches
forth, so that I see Sandford&#8217;s face but dimly
through the haze. &#8220;If you mention teeth again,
until we&#8217;re back&ndash;&ndash;merely mention them&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll
throttle you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The train is in motion now, and the arc-lights
at the corners, enshrouded each by a zone of
mist, are flitting by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeats, and again his voice has
that minor strain of suppressed excitement,
&#8220;we&#8217;re hitting it just right. There&#8217;ll be rain,
or a flurry of snow, maybe, and the paddle feet
will be down in the clouds.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter VI&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Mark the Right, Sandford!&#8221;</span></h3>
<p>And they are. Almost before we have
stumbled off at the deserted station into
the surrounding darkness, Johnson&#8217;s familiar
bass is heralding the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions of &#8217;em, boys,&#8221; he assures us, &#8220;billions!
Couldn&#8217;t sleep last night for the racket
they made on the lake. Never saw anything
like it in the twenty years I&#8217;ve lived on the
bank. You sure have struck it this time. Right
this way,&#8221; he is staggering under the load of
our paraphernalia; &#8220;rig&#8217;s all ready and Molly&#8217;s
got the kettle on at home, waiting breakfast for
you.... Just as fat as you were last
year, ain&#8217;t ye?&#8221; a time-proven joke, for I weigh
one hundred and eight pounds. &#8220;Try to pull
you out, though; try to.&#8221; And his great laugh
drowns the roar of the retreating train.</p>
<p>At another time, that five-mile drive in the
denser darkness, just preceding dawn, would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
have been long perhaps, the springs of that antiquated
buckboard inadequate, the chill of that
damp October air piercing; but now&ndash;&ndash;we notice
nothing, feel nothing uncomfortable. My
teeth chatter a bit now and then, when I am off
guard, to be sure; but it is not from cold, and
the vehicle might be a Pullman coach for aught
I am conscious.</p>
<p>For we have reached the border of the marsh,
now, and are skirting its edge, and&ndash;&ndash;Yes, those
are ducks, really; that black mass, packed into
the cove at the lee of those clustering rushes,
protected from the wind, the whole just distinguishable
from the lighter shadow of the
water: ducks and brant; dots of white, like the
first scattered snowflakes on a sooty city roof!</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark the right, Sandford,&#8221; I whisper in
oblivion. &#8220;Mark the right!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, breaking the spell, Johnson laughs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter VII&ndash;&ndash;The Bacon What Am!</span></h3>
<p>When is bacon bacon, and eggs eggs?
When is coffee coffee, and the despised
pickerel, fresh from the cold water of the
shaded lake, a glorious brown food, fit for the
gods?</p>
<p>Answer, while Molly (whose real name is
Aunt Martha) serves them to us, forty-five
minutes later.</p>
<p>Oh, if we only had time to eat, as that breakfast
deserves to be eaten! If we only had time!</p>
<p>But we haven&#8217;t; no; Sandford says so, in a
voice that leaves no room for argument. The
sky is beginning to redden in the east; the surface
of the water reflects the glow, like a mirror;
and, seen through the tiny-paned windows,
black specks, singly and in groups, appear and
disappear, in shifting patterns, against the
lightening background.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more now, Aunt Martha&ndash;&ndash;no. Wait
until noon; just wait&ndash;&ndash;and <i>then</i> watch us!
Ready, Ed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Waiting for you, Sam.&#8221; It&#8217;s been a year
since I called him by his Christian name; but I
never notice, nor does he. &#8220;All ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better try the point this morning; don&#8217;t
you think, Johnson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you&#8217;ve your eye with ye. Won&#8217;t
wait while y&#8217; sprinkle salt on their tails, them
red-heads and canvas boys. No, sir-ree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter VIII&ndash;&ndash;Feathered Bullets</span></h3>
<p>The breath of us is whistling through
our nostrils, like the muffled exhaust of a
gasoline engine, and our hearts are thumping
two-steps on our ribs from the exertion, when
we reach the end of the rock-bestrewn point
which, like a long index finger, is thrust out
into the bosom of the lake. The wind, still dead
north, and laden with tiny drops of moisture,
like spray from a giant atomizer, buffets us
steadily; but thereof we are sublimely unconscious.</p>
<p>For at last we are there, there; precisely
where we were yesterday&ndash;&ndash;no, a year ago&ndash;&ndash;and
the light is strong enough now, so that when
our gun-barrels stand out against the sky, we
can see the sights, and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Down! Down, behind the nearest stunted
willow tree; behind anything&ndash;&ndash;quick!&ndash;&ndash;for
they&#8217;re coming: a great dim wedge, with the
apex toward us, coming swiftly on wings that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
propel two miles to the minute, when backed by
a wind that makes a mile in one.</p>
<p>Coming&ndash;&ndash;no; arrived. Fair overhead are
the white of breasts, of plump bodies flashing
through the mist, the swishing hiss of many
wings cutting the air, the rhythmic <i>pat</i>, <i>pat</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>Bang!</i>
<i>Bang!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Was it Sandford&#8217;s gun, or was it mine? Who
knows? The reports were simultaneous.</p>
<p>And then&ndash;&ndash;<i>splash!</i> and a second later,&ndash;&ndash;<i>splash!</i>
as two dots leave the hurtling
wedge and, with folded wings, pitch at an
angle, following their own momentum, against
the dull brown surface of the rippling water.</p>
<p>Through the intervening branches and dead
sunflower stalks, I look at Sandford&ndash;&ndash;to find
that Sandford is looking at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, old man!&#8221; I say, and notice
that my voice is a little higher than normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, yourself,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;generously. &#8220;I
missed clean, both barrels. Do better next time,
though, perhaps.... <i>Down!</i> Mark
north! Take the leader, you.&#8221;</p>
<p>From out the mist, dead ahead, just skimming
the surface of the water, and coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
straight at us, like a mathematically arranged
triangle of cannon balls, taking definite form
and magnitude oh, so swiftly, unbelievably
swift; coming&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;directly overhead, as before,
the pulsing, echoing din in our ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ready!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the four reports that sounded as two;
and they are past; no longer a regular formation,
but scattered erratically by the alarm, individual
vanishing and dissolving dots, speedily
swallowed up by the gray of the mist.</p>
<p>But this time there was no echoing splash, as
a hurtling body struck the water, nor tense
spoken word of congratulation following&ndash;&ndash;nothing.
For ten seconds, which is long under
the circumstances, not a word is spoken; only
the metallic click of opened locks, as they spring
home, breaks the steady purr of the wind; then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe from me when they come like that,&#8221;
admits Sandford, &#8220;unless I have a ten-foot
pole, and they happen to run into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And from me,&#8221; I echo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, how they come! They just simply
materialize before your eyes, like an impression
by flash-light; and then&ndash;&ndash;vanish.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems as though they&#8217;d take fire, like meteorites,
from the friction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for the smoke, myself&ndash;&ndash;<i>Down!</i>
Mark your left!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Pat!</i> <i>pat!</i> <i>pat!</i> Swifter than spoken
words, swift as the strokes of an electric fan,
the wings beat the air. <i>Swish-h-h!</i> long-drawn
out, <i>crescendo</i>, yet <i>crescendo</i> as, razor-keen, irresistible,
those same invisible wings cut it
through and through; while, answering the
primitive challenge, responding to the stimulus
of the game, the hot tingle of excitement speeds
up and down our spines. Nearer, nearer,
mounting, perpendicular&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The third battalion of that seemingly inexhaustible
army has come and gone; and, mechanically,
we are thrusting fresh shells into
the faintly smoking gun-barrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got mine that time, both of them.&#8221; No repression,
nor polite self-abnegation from Sandford
this time; just plain, frank exultation and
pride of achievement. &#8220;Led &#8217;em a yard&ndash;&ndash;two,
maybe; but I got &#8217;em clean. Did you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, good work,&#8221; I echo in the formula.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Canvas-backs, every one; nothing but canvas-backs.&#8221;
Again the old marvel, the old palliation
that makes the seemingly unequal game
fair. &#8220;But, Lord, how they do go; how anything
alive can go so&ndash;&ndash;and be stopped!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark to windward! Straight ahead!
<i>Down!</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter IX&ndash;&ndash;Oblivion</span></h3>
<p>This, the morning. Then, almost before
we mark the change, swift-passing
time has moved on; the lowering mist has lifted;
the occasional pattering rain-drops have ceased;
the wind, in sympathy, is diminished. And of a
sudden, arousing us to a consciousness of time
and place, the sun peeps forth through a rift in
the scattering clouds, and at a point a bit south
of the zenith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noon!&#8221; comments Sandford, intensely surprised.
Somehow, we are always astonished
that noon should follow so swiftly upon sunrise.
&#8220;Well, who would have thought it!&#8221;</p>
<p>That instant I am conscious, for the first
time, of a certain violent aching void making
insistent demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have done so before, but now
that you mention it, I do think it emphatically.&#8221;
This is a pitiful effort at a jest, but it passes
unpunished. &#8220;There comes Johnson to bring
in the birds.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>After dinner&ndash;&ndash;and oh, what a dinner! for,
having adequate time to do it justice, we drag
it on and on, until even Aunt Martha is satisfied&ndash;&ndash;we
curl up in the sunshine, undimmed and
gloriously warm; we light our briers, and, too
lazily, nervelessly content to even talk, lay
looking out over the blue water that melts and
merges in the distance with the bluer sky above.
After a bit, our pipes burn dead and our eyelids
drop, and with a last memory of sunlight
dancing on a myriad tiny wavelets, and a
blessed peace and abandon soaking into our
very souls we doze, then sleep, sleep as we never
sleep in the city; as we had fancied a short day
before never to sleep again; dreamlessly, childishly,
as Mother Nature intended her children
to sleep.</p>
<p>Then, from without the pale of utter oblivion,
a familiar voice breaks slowly upon our consciousness:
the voice of Johnson, the vigilant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got your blind all built, boys, and the decoys
is out&ndash;&ndash;four dozen of them,&#8221; he admonishes,
sympathetically. &#8220;Days are getting
short, now, so you&#8217;d better move lively, if you
get your limit before dark.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter X&ndash;&ndash;Upon &#8220;Wiping the Eye&#8221;</span></h3>
<p>&#8220;To poets and epicures, perhaps, the lordly
canvas-back&ndash;&ndash;though brown from the
oven, I challenge the supercilious <i>gourmet</i> to
distinguish between his favorite, and a fat
American coot. But for me the loud-voiced
mallard, with his bottle-green head and audaciously
curling tail; for he will decoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am quoting Sandford. Be that as it may,
we are there, amid frost-browned rushes that
rustle softly in the wind: a patch of shallow
open water, perhaps an acre in extent, to the
leeward of us, where the decoys, heading all to
windward, bob gently with the slight swell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this is something like sport,&#8221; adds my
companion, settling back comfortably in the
slough-grass blind, built high to the north to
cut out the wind, and low to the south to let in
the sun. &#8220;On the point, there, this morning
you scored on me, I admit it; but this is where
I shine: real shooting; one, or a pair at most, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
a time; no scratches; no excuses. Lead on, MacDuff,
and if you miss, all&#8217;s fair to the second
gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No small birds, either, understand: no teal,
or widgeon, or shovellers. This is a mallard
hole. Nothing but mallards goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is your chance, then.... <i>Now!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right. Now is my chance, indeed.</p>
<p>Over the sea of rushes, straight toward us, is
coming a pair, a single pair; and, yes, they are
unmistakably mallards. It is feeding time, or
resting time, and they are flying lazily, long
necks extended, searching here and there for the
promised lands. Our guns indubitably cover it;
and though I freeze still and motionless, my
nerves stretch tight in anticipation, until they
tingle all but painfully.</p>
<p>On the great birds come; on and still on, until
in another second&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>That instant they see the decoys, and, warned
simultaneously by an ancestral suspicion, they
swing outward in a great circle, without apparent
effort on their part, to reconnoitre.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>Though I do not stir, I hear the <i>pat!</i> <i>pat!</i>
of their wings, as they pass by at the side, just
out of gunshot. Then, <i>pat!</i> <i>pat!</i> back of me,
then, <i>pat!</i> <i>pat!</i> on the other side, until once
again I see them, from the tail of my eye, merge
into view ahead.</p>
<p>All is well&ndash;&ndash;very well&ndash;&ndash;and, suspicions
wholly allayed at last, they whirl for the second
oncoming; just above the rushes, now; wings
spread wide and motionless; sailing nearer,
nearer&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now!</i>&#8221; whispers Sandford, &#8220;<i>now!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of our nest suddenly peeps my gun barrel;
and, simultaneously, the wings, a second
before motionless, begin to beat the air in frantic
retreat.</p>
<p>But it is too late.</p>
<p><i>Bang!</i> What! not a feather drops?...
<i>Bang!</i> Quack! Quack! <i>Bang!</i> <i>Bang!</i>...
Splash!... Quack! Quack!
Quack!</p>
<p>That is the story&ndash;&ndash;all except for Sandford&#8217;s
derisive laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I tell you?&#8221; he exults. &#8220;Wiped
your eye for you that time, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world I missed&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; It is all
that I can say. &#8220;They looked as big as&ndash;&ndash;as
suspended tubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck-fever,&#8221; explains Sandford, laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right.&#8221; I feel my fighting-blood
rising, and I swear with a mighty wordless
oath that I&#8217;ll be avenged for that laugh.
&#8220;The day is young yet. If, before night, I
don&#8217;t wipe both your eyes, and wipe them
good&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you will, old man.&#8221; Sandford is
smiling understandingly, and in a flash I return
the smile with equal understanding. &#8220;And
when you do, laugh at me, laugh long and
loud.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Chapter XI&ndash;&ndash;The Cold Gray Dawn</span></h3>
<p>At a quarter of twelve o&#8217;clock a week later,
I slip out of my office sheepishly, and,
walking a half-block, take the elevator to the
fifth floor of the Exchange Building, on the
corner. The white enamel of Sandford&#8217;s tiny
box of an office glistens, as I enter the door, and
the tiling looks fresh and clean, as though
scrubbed an hour before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor&#8217;s back in the laboratory,&#8221; smiles the
white-uniformed attendant, as she grasps my
identity.</p>
<p>On a tall stool, beside the laboratory lathe,
sits Sandford, hard at work. He acknowledges
my presence with a nod&ndash;&ndash;and that is all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noon, Sandford,&#8221; I announce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d drop over to the club for
lunch, and a little smoke afterward. Want to
go along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t.&#8221; The whirr of the electric lathe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
never ceases. &#8220;Got to finish this bridge before
one o&#8217;clock. Sorry, old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry just &#8217;phoned and asked me to come
and bring you.&#8221; I throw the bait with studied
nicety. &#8220;He&#8217;s getting up a party to go out to
Johnson&#8217;s, and wants to talk things over a bit in
advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; Irony fairly drips from the
voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s always going somewhere.
Mustn&#8217;t have much else to do. Anyway,
can&#8217;t possibly meet him this noon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night, then.&#8221; I suggest tentatively.
&#8220;He can wait until then, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to work to-night, too. Things are all
piled up on me.&#8221; Sandford applies a fresh
layer of pumice to the swiftly moving polishing
wheel, with practised accuracy. &#8220;Tell Harry
I&#8217;m sorry; but business is business, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Purr-r-r!</i>&#8221; drones on the lathe, &#8220;<i>purr-r-r!</i>&#8221;
I hear it as I silently slip away.</p>
<p>Yes, Sandford is sane; and will be for fifty-one
weeks.</p>

<h2>A FRONTIER ROMANCE: A TALE OF JUMEL MANSION</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>A new settlement in a new country: no
contemporary mind can conceive the possibilities
of future greatness that lie in the fulfilment
of its prophecy.</p>
<p>A long, irregular quadrangle has been hewn
from the woods bordering the north bank of the
Ohio River. Scattered through the clearing are
rude houses, built of the forest logs. Bounding
the space upon three sides, and so close that its
storm music sounds plain in every ear, is the
forest itself. On the fourth side flows the wide
river, covered now, firm and silent, with a thick
ice blanket. Across the river on the Kentucky
shore, softened by the blue haze of distance,
another forest crowds down to the very water&#8217;s
edge.</p>
<p>It is night, and of the cabins in the clearing
each reflects, in one way or another, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
character of its builder. Here a broad pencil
of light writes &#8220;Careless!&#8221; on the black
sheet of the forest; there a mere thread escaping
tells of patient carpentry.</p>
<p>At one end of the clearing, so near the forest
that the top of a falling tree would have
touched it, stood a cabin, individual in its complete
darkness except for a dull ruddy glow at
one end, where a window extended as high as
the eaves. An open fire within gnawed at the
half-green logs, sending smoke and steam up
the cavernous chimney, and casting about the
room an uncertain, fitful light&ndash;&ndash;now bright,
again shadowy.</p>
<p>It was a bare room that the flickering firelight
revealed, bare alike as to its furnishings
and the freshness of its peeled logs, the spaces
between which had been &#8220;chinked&#8221; with clay
from the river-bank. Scarcely a thing built of
man was in sight which had not been designed
to kill; scarcely a product of Nature which had
not been gathered at cost of animal life. Guns
of English make, stretched horizontally along
the walls upon pegs driven into the logs; in the
end opposite the wide fireplace, home-made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
cooking utensils dangled from the end of a
rough table, itself a product of the same factory.
In front of the fire, just beyond the
blaze and the coals and ashes, were heaped the
pelts of various animals; black bear and cinnamon
rested side by side with the rough, shaggy
fur of the buffalo, brought by Indians from the
far western land of the Dakotas.</p>
<p>Upon the heap, dressed in the picturesque
utility garb of buckskin, homespun, and &#8220;hickory&#8221;
which stamped the pioneer of his day, a
big man lay at full length: a large man even
here, where the law of the fittest reigned
supreme. A stubbly growth of beard covered
his face, giving it the heavy expression common
to those accustomed to silent places, and dim
forest trails.</p>
<p>Aside from his size, there was nothing striking
or handsome about this backwoods giant,
neither of face nor of form; yet, sleeping or
waking, working or at leisure, he would be
noticed&ndash;&ndash;and remembered. In his every feature,
every action, was the absolute unconsciousness
of self, which cannot be mistaken;
whether active or passive, there was about him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
an insinuation of reserve force, subtly felt, of a
strong, determined character, impossible to
sway or bend. He lay, now, motionless, staring
with wide-open eyes into the fire and breathing
slowly, deeply, like one in sleep.</p>
<p>There was a hammering upon the door; another,
louder; then a rattling that made the
walls vibrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; called the man, rousing and rolling
away from the fire.</p>
<p>A heavy shoulder struck the door hard, and
the screaming wooden hinges covered the sound
of the entering footfall.</p>
<p>He who came was also of the type: homespun
and buckskin, hair long and face unshaven.
He straightened from a passage which was not
low, then turning pushed the unwieldy door
shut. It closed reluctantly, with a loud shrilling
of its frost-bound hinges and frame. In a
moment he dropped his hands and impatiently
kicked the stubborn offender home, the suction
drawing a puff of smoke from the fireplace into
the room, and sending the ashes spinning in
miniature whirlwinds upon the hearth.</p>
<p>The man on the floor contemplated the entry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
with indifference; but a new light entered his
eyes as he recognized his visitor, though his face
held like wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evenin&#8217;, Clayton,&#8221; he greeted, nodding
toward a stool by the hearth. &#8220;Come over &#8217;n sit
down to the entertainment.&#8221; A whimsical
smile struggled through the heavy whiskers.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been seeing all sorts of things in there&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a
thoughtful nod toward the fire. &#8220;Guess,
though, a fellow generally does see what he&#8217;s
looking for in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Bud,&#8221; the visitor bluntly broke in,
coming into the light and slurring a dialect of
no nationality pure, &#8220;y&#8217; can&#8217;t stop me thataway.
There ain&#8217;t no use talkin&#8217; about the
weather, neither.&#8221; A motion of impatience;
then swifter, with a shade of menace:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I came over fer. It&#8217;s
actin&#8217; the fool, I know, we few families out
here weeks away from ev&#8217;rybody, but this
clearin&#8217; can&#8217;t hold us both.&#8221;</p>
<p>The menace suddenly left the voice, unconsciously
giving place to a note of tenderness
and of vague self-fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love that girl better &#8217;n you er life er anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
else, Bud; I tell ye this square to yer
face. I can&#8217;t stand it. I followed ye last night
clean home from the party&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I had a knife.
I jest couldn&#8217;t help it. Every time I know
nex&#8217; time it&#8217;ll happen. I don&#8217;t ask ye to give
her up, Bud, but to settle it with me now, fair
an&#8217; open, &#8217;fore I do something I can&#8217;t help.&#8221;</p>
<p>He strode swiftly to and fro across the room
as he spoke, his skin-shod feet tapping muffled
upon the bare floor, like the pads of an animal.
The fur of his leggings, rubbing together as he
walked, generated static sparks which snapped
audibly. He halted presently by the fireplace,
and looked down at the man lying there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;tween us, Bud,&#8221; he said, passion quivering
in his voice.</p>
<p>Minutes passed before Bud Ellis spoke, then
he shifted his head, quickly, and for the first
time squarely met Clayton&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it&#8217;s between you and me,&#8221; he initiated
slowly: &#8220;how do you propose to settle
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man hesitated, then his face grew
red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye make it hard for me, Bud, &#8217;s though I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
was a boy talkin&#8217; to ye big here; but it&#8217;s true,
as I told ye: I ain&#8217;t myself when I see ye settin&#8217;
close to &#8217;Liz&#8217;beth, er dancin&#8217; with your arm
touchin&#8217; hern. I ain&#8217;t no coward, Bud; an&#8217; I
can&#8217;t give her up&ndash;&ndash;to you ner nobody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate it. We&#8217;ve always been like brothers
afore, an&#8217; it &#8217;pears kinder dreamy &#8217;n foolish &#8217;n
unnatural us settin&#8217; here talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout it; but
there ain&#8217;t no other way I can see. I give ye
yer choice, Bud: I&#8217;ll fight ye fair any way y&#8217;
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis&#8217;s attitude remained unchanged: one big
hand supported his chin while he gazed silently
into the fire. Clayton stood contemplating him
a moment, then sat down.</p>
<p>By and by Ellis&#8217;s head moved a little, a very
little, and their eyes again met. A minute
passed, and in those seconds the civilization of
each man moved back generations.</p>
<p>The strain was beyond Clayton; he bounded
to his feet with a motion that sent the stool
spinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;God A&#8217;mighty! Are y&#8217; wood er are y&#8217; a
coward? Y&#8217; seem to think I&#8217;m practisin&#8217;
speech-makin&#8217;. D&#8217;ye know what it means fer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
me to come up here like this to you?&#8221; He
waited, but there was no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell ye fer the last time, I love that girl,
an&#8217; if it warn&#8217;t fer you&ndash;&ndash;fer you, Bud Ellis&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;d
marry me. Can ye understand that?
Now will ye fight?&ndash;&ndash;or won&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>A movement, swift and easy, like a released
spring, the unconscious trick of a born athlete,
and Ellis was upon his feet. Involuntarily,
Clayton squared himself, as if an attack were
imminent.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t fight you,&#8221; said the big man,
slowly. Without the least hesitation, he advanced
and laid a hand upon the other man&#8217;s
shoulder, facing him at arm&#8217;s length and speaking
deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that I&#8217;m afraid of you, either,
Bert Clayton; you know it. You say you love
her; I believe you. I love her, too. And Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;you
have tried, and I have tried&ndash;&ndash;and
she told us both the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;God, man! I know how you feel. I&#8217;ve
expected something like this a long time.&#8221; He
drew his hand across his eyes, and turned away.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had murder in my heart when I saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
you, and hated myself. It&#8217;s only in such places
as this, where nothing happens to divert one&#8217;s
mind, that people get like you and me, Bert.
We brood and brood, and it&#8217;s love and insanity
and a good deal of the animal mixed. Yes,
you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s between you and me, Bert,&ndash;&ndash;but
not to fight. One of us has got to
leave&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be me,&#8221; Clayton quickly broke in.
&#8220;I tell ye, I&#8217;d rather die, than leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a full minute Ellis steadily returned the
other man&#8217;s fiery look, then went on as though
there had been no interruption:</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and the sooner we go the better. How do
you want to settle it&ndash;&ndash;shall we draw straws?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll not draw straws. Go ef you&#8217;re
afraid; but I won&#8217;t stir a step. I came to warn
ye, or to fight ye if y&#8217; wanted. Seein&#8217; y&#8217; won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis stepped quickly in front of the door,
and with the motion Clayton&#8217;s hand went to his
knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, man,&#8221; demanded Ellis, sternly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re not savages. Let&#8217;s settle this matter
in civilized fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>They confronted each other for a moment,
the muscles of Clayton&#8217;s face twitching an accompaniment
to the nervous fingering of the
buckhorn hilt; then he stepped up until they
could have touched.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; y&#8217; mean anyway?&#8221; he blazed. &#8220;Get
out o&#8217; my road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis leaned against the door-bar without a
word. The fire had burned down, and in the
shadow his face had again the same expression
of heaviness. The breathing of Clayton, swift
and short, like one who struggles physically,
painfully intensified the silence of that dimly
lighted, log-bound room.</p>
<p>With his right hand Clayton drew his knife;
he laid his left on the broad half-circle of wood
that answered as a door handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open that door,&#8221; he demanded huskily, &#8220;or
by God, I&#8217;ll stab ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the half-light the men faced each other, so
near their breaths mingled. Twice Clayton
tried to strike. The eyes of the other man held
him powerless, and to save his life&ndash;&ndash;even to
satisfy a new, fierce hate&ndash;&ndash;he could not stir.
He stood a moment thus, then an animal-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
frenzy, irresistible but impotent, seized him.
He darted his head forward and spat in the
heavy face so close to his own.</p>
<p>The unspeakable contempt of the insult
shattered Bud Ellis&#8217;s self-control. Prompted
by blind fury, the great fist of the man shot out,
hammer-like, and Clayton crumpled at his feet.
It was a blow that would have felled the proverbial
ox; it was the counterpart of many other
blows, plus berserker rage, that had split pine
boards for sheer joy in the ability to do so.
These thoughts came sluggishly to the inflamed
brain, and Ellis all at once dropped to his knees
beside the limp, prostrate figure.</p>
<p>He bent over Clayton, he who had once been
his friend. He was scarcely apprehensive at
first, and he called his name brusquely; then,
as grim conviction grew, his appeals became
frantic.</p>
<p>At last Ellis shrank away from the Thing
upon the floor. He stared until his eyeballs
burnt like fire. It would never, while time
lasted, move again.</p>
<p>Horror unutterable fell upon him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>In the year 1807 there were confined in
a common Western jail, amid a swarm of
wretches of every degree of baseness, two men
as unlike as storm and sunshine. One was
charged with treason, the other with murder;
conviction, in either case, meant death.</p>
<p>One was a man of middle age, an aristocrat
born; a college graduate and a son of a college
graduate; a man handsome of appearance, passionate
and ambitious, who knew men&#8217;s natures
as he knew their names. He had fought bravely
for his country, and his counsels had helped
mould the foundations of the new republic.
Honored by his fellow-men, he had served brilliantly
in such exalted positions as that of
United States Senator, and Attorney General
for the State of New York. On one occasion,
only a single vote stood between him and the
presidency.</p>
<p>His name was Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>The other was a big backwoodsman of
twenty, whose life had been as obscure as
that of a domestic animal. He was rough of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
manner and slow of speech, and just now,
owing to a combination of physical confinement
and mental torture altogether unlovely in
disposition.</p>
<p>This man was Bud Ellis.</p>
<p>The other prisoners&ndash;&ndash;a motley lot of frontier
reprobates&ndash;&ndash;ate together, slept together,
and quarrelled together. Looking constantly
for trouble, and thrown into actual contact
with an object as convenient as Aaron Burr,
it was inevitable that he should be made the
butt of their coarse gibes and foul witticisms;
and when these could not penetrate his calm,
superior self-possession, it was just as inevitable
that taunts should extend even to worse
indignities.</p>
<p>Burr was not the man to be stirred against
his calm judgment; but one day his passionate
nature broke loose, and he and the offender
came to blows.</p>
<p>There were a dozen prisoners in the single
ill-lighted, log-bound room, and almost to a
man they attacked him. The fight would not
have lasted long had not the inequality appealed
to Ellis on the second.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>Moreover, with him, the incident was to the
moment opportune. If ever a man was in the
mood for war, it was the big, square-jawed
pioneer. He was reckless and desperate for the
first time in his life, and he joined with Burr
against the room, with the abandon of a
madman.</p>
<p>For minutes they fought. Elbows and
knees, fists and feet, teeth and tough-skulled
heads; every hard spot and every sharp angle
bored and jabbed at the crushing mass which
swiftly closed them in. They struggled like
cats against numbers, and held the wall until
the sound of battle brought the negligent guard
running, and the muzzle of a carbine peeped
through the grating. Burr and Ellis came out
with scarce a rag and with many bruises, but
with the new-born lust of battle hot within
them. Ellis glowered at the enemy, and having
of the two the more breath, fired the parting
shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;How I&#8217;d like to take you fellows out, one
at a time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>From that day the two men were kept apart
from the others, and the friendship grew. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Burr chose, neither man nor woman could resist
him. He chose now and Ellis, by habit and by
nature silent, told of his life and of his thoughts.
It was a new tale to Burr, these dream products
of a strong man, and of solitude; and so, listening,
he forgot his own trouble. The hard look
that had formed over his face in the three years
past vanished, leaving him again the natural,
fascinating man who had first taken the
drawing-room of the rare old Jumel mansion
by storm. It was genuine, this tale that Ellis
told; it was strong, with the savor of Mother
Nature and of wild things, and fascinating with
the beauty of unconscious telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl?&#8221; asked Burr after Ellis
finished a passionate account of the last year.
Unintentionally, he touched flame to tinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me about her. I&#8217;m not fit. She
was coming to see me, but I wouldn&#8217;t let her.
She&#8217;s good and innocent; she never imagined
we were not as strong as she, and it&#8217;s killing
her. There&#8217;s no question what will happen to
me; everything is against me, and I&#8217;ll be
convicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one understands&ndash;&ndash;she can&#8217;t herself;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
but she feels responsible for one of us, already,
and will feel the same for me when it&#8217;s over.
Anyway, I&#8217;d never see her again. I feel different
toward her now, and always would. I&#8217;d
never live over again days like I have in the
past year: days I hated a friend I&#8217;d known all
my life&ndash;&ndash;because we both loved the same
woman. If the Almighty sent love of woman
into the world to be bought at the price I paid,
it&#8217;s wrong, and He&#8217;s made a mistake. It&#8217;s
contrary to Nature, because Nature is kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last summer I&#8217;d sit out of doors at night
and watch the stars come out thick, like old
friends, till I&#8217;d catch the mood and be content.
The wind would blow up from the south,
softly, like some one fanning me, and the frogs
and crickets would sing even and sleepy, and
I&#8217;d think of her and be as nearly happy as it
was possible for me to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, somehow, he&#8217;d drift into the picture,
and it grated. I&#8217;d wonder why this love of
woman, which ought to make one feel the best
of everything there is in life; which ought to
make one kinder and tenderer to every one,
should make me hate him, my best friend. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
night would be spoiled, and from then on the
crickets would sing out of tune. I&#8217;d go to bed,
where, instead of sleeping, I would try to find
out, and couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;And at last, that night&ndash;&ndash;and the end! Oh,
it&#8217;s horrible, horrible! I wish to God they&#8217;d
try me quick, and end it. It makes me hate that
girl to think she&#8217;s the cause. And that makes
me hate myself, for I know she&#8217;s innocent. Oh,
it&#8217;s tangled&ndash;&ndash;tangled&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the trial which followed, the world knows.
How Burr pleaded his own case, and of the
brilliancy of the pleading, history makes record
at length. &#8217;T was said long before, when the
name of Burr was proud on the Nation&#8217;s tongue&ndash;&ndash;years
before that fatal morning on Weekawken
Heights&ndash;&ndash;that no judge could decide
against him. Though reviled by half the nation,
it would seem it were yet true.</p>
<p>Another trial followed; but of this history is
silent, though Aaron Burr pleaded this case as
well. It was a trial for manslaughter, and
every circumstance, even the prisoner&#8217;s word,
declared guilt. To show that a person may be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
guilty in act, and at the same time, in reality, innocent,
calls for a master mind&ndash;&ndash;the mind of
a Burr. To tell of passion, one must have felt
passion, and of such Burr had known his full
share. No lawyer for the defence was ever
better prepared than Burr, and he did his best.
In court he told the jury a tale of motive, of
circumstance, and of primitive love, such as had
never been heard in that county before; such
that the twelve men, without leaving their seats,
brought a verdict of &#8220;Not guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you right,&#8221; said the big man,
with a catch in his voice, wringing Burr&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try,&#8221; interrupted Burr, quickly.
&#8220;You did as much for me.&#8221; And even Burr
did not attempt to say any more just then.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The two men went East together, travelling
days where now hours would suffice. Why Burr
took the countryman home with him, knowing,
as he did, the incongruity of such a step, he himself
could not have told. It puzzled Ellis still
more. He had intended going far away to
some indefinite place; but this opportunity of
being virtually thrust into the position where he
most wished to be, was unusual; it was a reversal
of all precedent; and so why demur?</p>

<p>On the way, Burr told much of his life&ndash;&ndash;probably
more than he had told before in years.
He knew that the sympathy of Ellis was sincere,
and a disinterested motive was with him a
new thing, a key to confidence.</p>
<p>A woman was at this time, and had been for
years, foremost in Burr&#8217;s mind. He was going
to see her now; beyond that his plans were dim.
During a career of politics, there had crept into
the man&#8217;s life much that was hard and worldly;
but this attachment was from ambition far
apart&ndash;&ndash;his most sacred thing.</p>
<p>She was a brilliant woman, this friend of
Burr&#8217;s; one whom many sought; but it was not
this which influenced him. She had been his
best friend, and had taken him into her own
home during the darkest hour of his life, when
condemnation was everywhere. Gossip had
fluttered, but to no avail. Burr never forgot a
friend, and in this case it was more than friendship:
it was a genuine love that lasted; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
years later, in his old age and hers as well, old
Jumel mansion made gay at their wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you expect to do?&#8221; asked Burr
of Ellis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything just now that will make me forget,&#8221;
answered the countryman, quickly. &#8220;So
there&#8217;s enough of it is all that I ask. I&#8217;m going
to get a little more education first. Sometime
I&#8217;ll study law&ndash;&ndash;that is, if I&#8217;m here
&#8216;sometime.&#8217; I&#8217;ve got to be where there&#8217;s life
and action. I&#8217;ll never end by being common.&#8221;
He paused a moment, and on his face there
formed the peculiar heavy look that had confronted
Clayton; a mask that hid a determination,
which nothing of earth could shake. He
finished slowly: &#8220;I&#8217;ll either be something, or
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biographers leave the impression that at this
time Burr was devoid of prestige on earth.
Politically, this is true; but respecting his standing
with the legal fraternity, it is wholly false.
He had influence, and he used it, securing the
stranger a place in a New York office, where his
risk depended only upon himself. More than
this, he gave Ellis money.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can pay me any interest you wish,&#8221;
said he when the latter protested.</p>
<p>Ellis had been settled a week. One evening
he sat in the back room of the city office, fighting
the demon of homesickness with work, and
the light of an open fire. It was late, and he
had studied till Nature rebelled; now he sat in
his own peculiar position, gazing into the glow,
motionless and wide-eyed.</p>
<p>He started at a tap on the door, and the past
came back in a rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>Burr entered, and closed the door carefully
behind him. Ellis motioned to a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t sit down,&#8221; said Burr. &#8220;I&#8217;m
only going to stay a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came over to the blaze, looking down on
the other man&#8217;s head. Finally he laid a hand
on Ellis&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lonesome, eh?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>The student nodded silent assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Burr, beginning to pace up
and down the narrow room. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221;
he burst out at last, &#8220;this town is like hell to
me. Every hand is against me. There&#8217;s not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
one man here, beside you, whom I can trust. I
can&#8217;t stand it. I&#8217;m going to leave the country.
Some day I&#8217;ll come back; but now it&#8217;s too
much.&#8221; There was the accumulated bitterness
of months in his voice. &#8220;My God!&#8221; he interjected,
&#8220;you&#8217;d think these people never did
anything wrong in their lives.&#8221; He stopped and
laid his hand again on the other man&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;But enough of this&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t come to
make you more lonesome. I want you to meet
my friends before I go. You&#8217;ll go out with
me to-morrow afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish. You know what I am,&#8221; said
Ellis.</p>
<p>Burr&#8217;s hand rested a moment longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he said simply.</p>
<p>Some eight or ten miles north of the beach,
on the island of Manhattan, stood Jumel home;
a fine, white house, surrounded by a splendid
lawn and gardens. A generation had already
passed since its erection, and the city was slowly
creeping near. It was a stately specimen of
Colonial domestic architecture, built on simple,
restful lines, and distinguished by the noble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
columns of its Grecian front. Destined to be
diminished, the grounds had already begun to
shrink; but from its commanding position it
had a view that was magnificent, overlooking as
it did, the Hudson, the Harlem, the East
River, the Sound, and upon every side, miles
upon miles of undulating land.</p>
<p>On the way, and again upon the grounds,
Burr related the history of the old landmark,
telling much with the fascination of personal
knowledge. The tale of the Morrises, of Washington
and of Mary Philipse was yet upon his
tongue, as he led Ellis through the broad pillared
entrance, into the great hall.</p>
<p>Things moved swiftly, very swiftly and very
dreamily, to the countryman in the next few
hours. Nothing but the lack of ability prevented
his vanishing at the sound of approaching
skirts; nothing but physical timidity prevented
his answering the greeting of the
hostess; nothing but conscious awkwardness
prompted the crude bow that answered the
courtesy of the girl with the small hands, and
the dark eyes who accompanied her&ndash;&ndash;the first
courtesy from powdered maid of fashion that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
he had ever known. Her name, Mary Philipse,
coming so soon after Burr&#8217;s story, staggered
him, and, open-mouthed, he stood looking at
her. Remembrance came to Burr simultaneously,
and he touched Ellis on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, my friend,&#8221; he laughed;
&#8220;she&#8217;s not the one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis grew red to the ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave you to Mary,&#8221; said Burr retreating
with a smile; &#8220;she&#8217;ll tell you the rest&ndash;&ndash;from
where I left off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl with the big brown eyes was still
smiling in an amused sort of way, but Ellis
showed no resentment. He knew that to her he
was a strange animal&ndash;&ndash;very new and very
peculiar. He did not do as a lesser man would
have done, pretend knowledge of things unknown,
but looked the girl frankly in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but it was all rather sudden,&#8221;
he explained. The red had left his face now.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve only known a few women&ndash;&ndash;and they
were not&ndash;&ndash;of your class. This is Mr. Burr&#8217;s
joke, not mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smile faded from the girl&#8217;s face. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
met him on his own ground, and they were
friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take it that way,&#8221; she protested,
quickly. &#8220;I see, he&#8217;s been telling you of
Washington&#8217;s Mary Philipse. It merely happens
that my name is the same. I&#8217;m simply a
friend visiting here. Can&#8217;t I show you the
house? It&#8217;s rather interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Ellis was a novelty to the woman, she was
equally so to him. Unconventionality reigned
in that house, and they were together an hour.
Never before in his life had Ellis learned so
much, nor caught so many glimpses of things
beyond, in an equal length of time. His idea of
woman had been trite, a little vague. He had
no ideal; he had simply accepted, without question,
the one specimen he had known well.</p>
<p>In an uncertain sort of way he had thought
of the sex as being invariably creatures of unquestioned
virtue, but of mind somewhat defective;
who were to be respected and protected,
loved perhaps with the love animals know; but
of such an one as this he had no conception.</p>
<p>Here was a woman, younger than he, whose
unconscious familiarity with things, which to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
him lay hidden in the dark land of ignorance,
affected him like a stimulant. A woman who
had read and travelled and thought and felt;
whose mind met him even in the unhesitating
confidence of knowledge&ndash;&ndash;it is no wonder that
he was in a dream. It turned his little world
upside down: so brief a time had elapsed since
he had cursed woman for bringing crime into
his life, in the narrowness of his ignorance
thinking them all alike. He was in the presence
of a superior, and his own smallness came over
him like a flood.</p>
<p>He mentally swore, then and there, with a
tightening of his jaw that meant finality, that
he would raise himself to her plane. The girl
saw the look, and wondered at it.</p>
<p>That night, at parting, the eyes of the two
met. A moment passed&ndash;&ndash;and another, and
neither spoke a word. Then a smile broke over
the face of Mary Philipse, and it was answered
on the face of the man. Equals had met equals.
At last the girl held out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call again, please,&#8221; she requested. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Years passed. Burr had gone and returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
again, and Jumel mansion had waxed festive to
honor his home-coming. Then he opened an
office in the city, and drab-colored routine fell
upon him&ndash;&ndash;to remain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Time had done much for Ellis&ndash;&ndash;rather,
it had allowed him to do much for himself.
He had passed through all the stages of
transition&ndash;&ndash;confusion, homesickness, despondency;
but incentive to do was ever with him.</p>
<p>At first he had worked to forget, and, in self-defence;
but Nature had been kind, and with
years memory touched him softly, as though it
were the past of another.</p>
<p>Then a new incentive came to him: an incentive
more potent than the former, and which
grew so slowly he did not recognize it, until he
met it unmistakably face to face. Again into
his life and against his will had crept a woman,
and this woman&#8217;s name was Mary Philipse. He
met her now on her own ground, but still, as of
old, with honors even. She had changed little
since he first saw her. As often as he called,
he met the same frank smile, and the brown eyes
still regarded him with the same old candid, unreserved
interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>Ellis was, as the town would have said, successful.
He had risen from a man-of-all-work
to the State bar, and an office of his own. He
had passed the decisive line and his rise was
simply a question of time. He was in a position
where he could do as he chose. He appreciated
that Mary Philipse was the incentive that
had put him where he was. She appealed to the
best there was in his nature. She caused him to
do better work, to think better thoughts. He
unselfishly wished her the best there was of life.
Just how much more he felt he did not know&ndash;&ndash;at
least this was sufficient.</p>
<p>He would ask her to marry him. It was not
the mad, dazzling passion of which poets sing;
but he was wiser than of yore. Of Mary he was
uncertain. That he was not the only man who
went often to old Jumel mansion he was well
aware, and with the determination to learn
certainties, there came a tenderer regard than
he had yet known.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Jumel was gay that night. There would be
few more such scenes, for the owner was no
longer young; but of this the throng in brocade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
and broadcloth and powder, who filled the
spacious mansion, were thoughtless. Everywhere
was an atmosphere of welcome; from the
steady light of lanterns festooned on facade and
lawn, to the sparkle of countless candles within.</p>
<p>It was that night that Ellis drew Mary
Philipse aside and told her the tale that grew
passionate in the telling. Fortune was kind,
for he told it to the soft accompaniment of
wine glasses ringing, and the slow music of the
stately minuet.</p>
<p>Mary Philipse heard him through without a
word, an expression on her face he had never
seen before. Then their eyes met in the same
frank way they had hundreds of times before,
and she gave him her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve expected this, and I&#8217;ve tried to be
ready; but I&#8217;m not. I can&#8217;t say no, and I can&#8217;t
say yes. I wouldn&#8217;t try to explain to any one
else, but I think you&#8217;ll understand. Forgive
me if I analyze you a little, and don&#8217;t interrupt,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>She passed her hand over her face slowly, a
shade wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times when I come near loving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
you: for what you are, not for what you are to
me. You are natural, you&#8217;re strong; but you
lack something I feel to be necessary to make
life completely happy&ndash;&ndash;the ability to forget all
and enjoy the moment. I have watched you
for years. It has been so in the past, and will
be so in the future. Other men who see me,
men born to the plane, have the quality&ndash;&ndash;call
it butterfly if you will&ndash;&ndash;to enjoy the &#8216;now.&#8217; It
appeals to me&ndash;&ndash;I am of their manner born.&#8221;
Their eyes met and she finished slowly, &#8220;It&#8217;s
injustice to you, I know; but I can&#8217;t answer&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat a moment side by side in silence.
The dancers were moving more swiftly to the
sound of the Virginia reel.</p>
<p>Ellis reached over and took her hand, then
bent and touched it softly with his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will wait&ndash;&ndash;and abide,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>THE CUP THAT O&#8217;ERFLOWED: AN OUTLINE</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>In a room, half-lighted by the red rays of a
harvest moon, a woman lay in the shadow;
face downward, on the bed. It was not the
figure of youth: the full lines of waist and hip
spoke maturity. She was sobbing aloud and
bitterly, so that her whole body trembled.</p>
<p>The clock struck the hour, the half, again the
hour; and yet she lay there, but quiet, with face
turned toward the window and the big, red
harvest moon. It was not a handsome face;
besides, now it was tear-stained and hard with
the reflection of a bitter battle fought.</p>
<p>A light foot tapped down the hallway and
stopped in front of the door. There was gentle
accompaniment on the panel to the query, &#8220;Are
you asleep?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>The woman on the bed opened her eyes wider,
without a word.</p>
<p>The step in the hall tapped away into silence.
The firm, round arm in its black elbow-sleeve
setting, white, beautiful, made a motion of impatience
and of weariness; then slowly, so
slowly that one could scarce mark its coming,
the blank stupor that comes as Nature&#8217;s panacea
to those whom she has tortured to the limit,
crept over the woman, and the big brown eyes
closed. The moon passed over and the night-wind,
murmuring lower and lower, became still.
In the darkness and silence the woman sobbed
as she slept.</p>
<p>In the lonely, uncertain time between night
and morning she awoke; her face and the pillow
were damp with the tears of sleep. She was
numb from the drawing of tight clothing, and
with a great mental pain and a confused sense
of sadness, that weighed on her like a tangible
thing. Her mind groped uncertainly for a
moment; then, with a great rush, the past night
and the things before it returned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God, Thy injustice to us women!&#8221; she
moaned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>The words roused her; and, craving companionship,
she rose and lit the gas.</p>
<p>Back and forth she crossed the room, avoiding
the furniture as by instinct&ndash;&ndash;one moment
smiling, bitter; the next with face moving, uncontrollable,
and eyes damp: all the moods, the
passions of a woman&#8217;s soul showing here where
none other might see. Tired out, at last, she
stopped and disrobed, swiftly, without a glance
at her own reflection, and returned to bed.</p>
<p>Nature will not be forced. Sleep will not
come again. She can only think, and thoughts
are madness. She gets up and moves to her
desk. Aimlessly at first, as a respite, she begins
to write. Her thoughts take words as she
writes, and a great determination, an impulse of
the moment, comes to her. She takes up fresh
paper and writes sheet after sheet, swiftly.
Passion sways the hand that writes, and shines
warmly from the big, brown eyes. The first
light of morning stains the east as she collects
the scattered sheets, and writes a name on the
envelope, a name which brings a tenderness to
her eyes. Stealthily she tiptoes down the stairs
and places the letter where the servant will see,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
and mail it in the early morning. A glad light,
the light of relief, is in her face as she steals
back slowly and creeps into bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is wrong I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; she
whispers low. She turns her face to the pillow
and covers it with a soft, white arm. One ear
alone shows, a rosy spot against the white.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Nine o&#8217;clock at a down-town medical office.
A man who walks rapidly, but quietly, enters
and takes up the morning mail. A number of
business letters he finds and a dainty envelope,
with writing which he knows at sight. He steps
to the light and looks at the postmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; says his partner, entering.</p>
<p>The man nods absently, and, tearing open
the envelope, takes out this letter:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My friend</span>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you will think of me
after this; anyway, I cannot help telling you
what to-night lies heavy on my heart and mind.
I&#8217;ve tried to keep still; God knows I&#8217;ve tried,
and so hard; but Nature is Nature, and I am a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
woman. Oh, if you men only knew what that
means, you&#8217;d forgive us much, and pity! You
have so much in life and we so little, and you
torture us so with that little, which to us is so
great, our all; leading us on against our will,
against our better judgment, until we love you,
not realizing at first the madness of unrequited
love. Oh, the cruelty of it, and but for a
pastime.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;But I do not mean to charge you. You are
not as other men; you are not wrong. Besides,
why should I not say it? I love you. Yes, you;
a man who knows not the meaning of the word;
who meant to be but a friend, my best friend.
Oh, you have been blind, blind all the years
since first I knew you; since first you began
telling me of yourself and of your hopes. You
did not know what it meant to such as I to live
in the ambition of another, to hope through
another&#8217;s hope, to exult in another&#8217;s success. I
am confessing, for the first time&ndash;&ndash;and the last
time. Know, man, all the time I loved you.
Forgive me that I tell you. I cannot help it. I
am a woman, and love in a woman&#8217;s life is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
stronger than will, stronger than all else
together.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I ask nothing. I expect nothing. I could
not keep quiet longer. It was killing me, and
you never saw. I did not mean to tell you anything,
till this moment&ndash;&ndash;least of all, in this
way. But it is done, and I&#8217;m glad&ndash;&ndash;yes, happier
than I have been for weeks. It is our
woman&#8217;s nature; a nature we do not ourselves
understand.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;My friend, I cannot see you again. Things
cannot go on as they were. It was torture&ndash;&ndash;you
know not what torture&ndash;&ndash;and life is short.
If you would be kind, avoid me. The town is
wide, and we have each our work. Time will
pass. Remember, you have done nothing
wrong. If there be one at fault it is Nature,
for only half doing her work. You are good
and noble. Good-bye. I trust you, for, God
bless you, I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter dropped, and the man stood looking
out with unseeing eyes, on the shifting
street.</p>
<p>A patient came in and sat down, waiting.</p>
<p>He had read as in a dream. Now with a rush
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
came thought,&ndash;&ndash;the past, the present, mingled;
and as by a great light he saw clearly the years
of comradery, thoughtless on his part, filled as
his life had been with work and with thought of
the future. It all came home to him now, and
the coming was of brightness. The coldness
melted from his face; the very squareness of the
jaw seemed softer; the knowledge that is joy
and that comes but once in a lifetime, swept
over him, warm, and his heart beat swift. All
things seemed beautiful.</p>
<p>Without a word he took up his hat, and
walked rapidly toward the elevator. A smile
was in the frank blue eyes, and to all whom he
met, whether stranger or friend, he gave
greeting.</p>
<p>The patient, waiting for his return, grew
tired and left, and leaving, slammed the office
door behind him.</p>

<h2>UNJUDGED</h2>
</div>
<p>The source of this manuscript lies in
tragedy. My possession of it is purely
adventitious. That I have had it long you may
know, for it came to me at an inland prairie
town, far removed from water or mountain,
while for ten years or more my name, above the
big-lettered dentist sign, has stood here on my
office window in this city by the lake. I have
waited, hoping some one would come as claimant;
but my hair is turning white and I can wait
no longer. As now I write of the past, the time
of the manuscript&#8217;s coming stands clear amid
a host of hazy, half-forgotten things.</p>
<p>It was after regular hours, of the day I write,
that a man came hurriedly into my office, complaining
of a fiercely aching tooth. Against
my advice he insisted on an immediate extraction,
and the use of an an&aelig;sthetic. I telephoned
for a physician, and while awaiting his coming
my patient placed in my keeping an expansible
leather-covered book of a large pocket size.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Should anything go wrong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there
are instructions inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The request is common from those unused to
an operation, and I accepted without other comment
than to assure him he need fear no danger.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, the physician made the customary
examination and proceeded to administer
chloroform. The patient was visibly excited,
but neither of us attached any importance
to that under the circumstances. Almost before
the effect of the an&aelig;sthetic was noticeable, however,
there began a series of violent muscular
spasms and contractions. The inhaler was removed
and all restoratives known to the profession
used, but without avail. He died in a
few moments, and without regaining consciousness.
The symptoms were suspicious, entirely
foreign to any caused by the an&aelig;sthetic, and at
the inquest the cause came to light. In the
man&#8217;s stomach was a large quantity of strychnine.
That he knew something of medicine is
certain, for the action of the alkaloid varies
little, and he had the timing to a nicety.</p>
<p>The man was, I should judge, thirty years
of age, smooth of face and slightly built. Nerve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
was in every line of face and body. He was
faultlessly dressed and perfectly groomed. He
wore no jewelry, not even a watch; but within
the pocket of his vest was found a small jewel-case
containing two beautiful white diamonds,
each of more than a carat weight. One was
unset, the other mounted in a lady&#8217;s ring. There
was money in plenty upon his person, but not
an article that would give the slightest clue to
his identity.</p>
<p>One peculiar thing about him I noticed, and
could not account for: upon the palm of each
hand was a row of irregular abrasions, but
slightly healed, and which looked as though
made by some dull instrument.</p>
<p>The book with which he entrusted me had
begun as a journal, but with the passage of
events it had outgrown its original plan. Being
expansible, fresh sheets had been added as
it grew, and at the back of the book, on one of
these blanks, had been hastily scratched, in
pencil, the message of which he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find sufficient money in my pockets
to cover all expenses. Do not take my
trinkets, please! Associations make them dear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
to me. Any attempt to discover my friends
will be useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the last sentence the body
was embalmed and the death advertised; but no
response came, and after three days the body
and the tokens he loved were quietly buried here
in the city.</p>
<p>Meantime I had read the book, beginning
from a sense of duty that grew into a passing
interest, and ended by making me unaware of
both time and place. I give you the journal
as it stands, word for word and date for date.
Would that I could show you the handwriting
in the original as well. No printed page can
tell the story of mood as can the lines of this
journal. There were moments of passion when
words slurred and overtook each other, as
thought moved more rapidly than the characters
which recorded; and again, periods of uncertainty
when the hand tarried and busied itself
with forming meaningless figures, while the
conscious mind roamed far away.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p><i>March 17.</i> Why do I begin a journal now,
a thing I have never done before? Had another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
asked the question, I could have turned it off
with a laugh, but with myself it will not do. I
must answer it, and honestly. Know then, my
ego who catechises, I have things to tell, feelings
to describe that are new to me and which I cannot
tell to another. The excuse sounds childish;
but listen: I speak it softly: I love, and he who
loves is ever as a child. I smile at myself for
making the admission. I, a man whose hair is
thinning and silvering, who has written of love
all his life, and laughed at it. Oh, it&#8217;s humorous,
deliciously humorous. To think that I have
become, in reality, the fool I pictured others in
fancy!</p>
<p><i>April 2.</i> Gods, she was beautiful to-night!&ndash;&ndash;the
way she came to meet me: the long skirt
that hung so gracefully, and that fluffy, white,
sleeveless thing that fitted her so perfectly and
showed her white arms and the curves of her
throat. I forgot to rise, and I fear I stared
at her. I can yet see the smile that crept
through the long lashes as she looked at me, and
as I stumbled an apology she was smiling all
the time. How I came away I swear I don&#8217;t
know. Instinct, I suppose; for now at last I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
have an incentive. I must work mightily, and
earn a name&ndash;&ndash;for her.</p>
<p><i>April 4.</i> He says it is a strong plot and that
he will help me. That means the book will succeed.
I wonder how a man feels who can do
things, not merely dream them. I expected he
would laugh when I told him the plot, especially
when I told whom the woman was; but
he didn&#8217;t say a word. He thinks, as I do, that
it would be better to leave the story&#8217;s connection
with her a surprise until the book is published.
He is coming up here to work to-morrow.
&#8220;Keep a plot warm,&#8221; he says:
&#8220;especially one with a love in it.&#8221; He looked at
me out of the corner of his eye as he spoke, so
peculiarly I hardly knew whether he was laughing
at me or not. I suppose, just now, my
state of mind is rather obvious and amusing.</p>
<p><i>May 3.</i> As I expected, the reaction is on.
What a price we have to pay for our happy
moments in this world! I&#8217;m tired to-night and
a little discouraged, for I worked hard all day,
and did not accomplish much. &#8220;Lack of inspiration,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The heroine is becoming a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
trifle dim. Hadn&#8217;t you better go and enthuse a
little to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not in a mood to be chaffed; I told him
shortly: &#8220;No, you had better go yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled and thanked me. &#8220;With your
permission,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nature certainly has been kind to him, for
he is handsome and fascinating beyond any man
I ever knew. I wanted to use him in the story,
but he positively refused. He said that I would
do better. So we finally compromised on a
combination. &#8220;The man&#8221; has his hair and my
eyes, his nose and my mouth. Over the chin we
each smiled a little grimly, for it is stubborn&ndash;&ndash;square,
and fits us both. After all, it is not a
bad <i>ensemble</i>. The character has his weak
points, but, all in all, he is not bad to look upon.</p>
<p><i>June 10.</i> We went driving this evening, she
and I, far out into the country, going and coming
slowly. The night was perfect, with a
full moon and a soft south wind. Nature&#8217;s
music makers were all busy. On the high
places, the crickets sang loudly their lonesome
song to the night, while from the distant river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
and lowlands there came the uncertain minor
of countless frogs in chorus.</p>
<p>For two hours I tasted happiness, divine
happiness, happiness so complete that I forgot
time.</p>
<p>I have known many beautiful women,
women splendid as animals are splendid, but
never before one whose intense womanliness
made me forget that she was beautiful. I can&#8217;t
explain; it is too subtle and holy a thing. I
sat by her side, so near that we touched, and
worshipped as I never worshipped at church. If
but for this night alone, my life is worth the
living.</p>
<p><i>June 12.</i> It seems peculiar that he should be
working with me at this story; strange that he
should care to know me at all. Perhaps I stand
a little in awe of the successful man; I think we
all do. At least, he is the example <i>par excellence</i>.
I have seen him go into a room filled
with total strangers, and though he never spoke
a word, have heard the question all about,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Who
is he?&#8221; Years ago, when he as well as I
was an unknown writer, we each submitted a
story to the same editor, by the same mail. Both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
were returned. I can still see the expression on
his face as he opened his envelope, and thrust
the manuscript into his pocket. He did not
say a word, but his manner of donning his top-coat
and hat, and the crash of the front door
behind him betrayed his disappointment. His
work was afterwards published at his own risk.
The ink on my story is fading, but I have it
still.</p>
<p><i>July 2.</i> She is going to the coast for the
season, and I called to-night to say <i>au revoir</i>.
I could see her only a few minutes as her carriage
was already waiting; something, I believe,
in honor of her last night in town. She was in
evening dress, and beautiful&ndash;&ndash;I cannot describe.
Think of the most beautiful woman you
have ever known, and then&ndash;&ndash;but it is useless,
for you have not known her.</p>
<p>I was intoxicated; happy as a boy; happy as
a god. I filled the few moments I had, full to
overflowing. I told her what every man tells
some woman some time in his life. For once I
felt the power of a master, and I spoke well.</p>
<p>She did not answer; I asked her not to. I
could not tell her all, and I would have no reply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
before. Her face was turned from me as
I spoke, but her ears turned pink and her
breath came quickly. I looked at her and the
magnitude of my presumption held me dumb;
yet a warm happy glow was upon me, and the
tapping of feet on the pavement below sounded
as sweetest music.</p>
<p>As I watched her she turned, her eyes glistening
and her throat all a-tremble. She held out
her hand to say good-bye. I took it in mine;
and at the touch my resolution and all other
things of earth were forgotten, and I did that
which I had come hoping to do. Gently, I
slipped a ring with a single setting over her
finger, then bending low, I touched the hand
with my lips&ndash;&ndash;whitest, softest, dearest hand
in God&#8217;s world. Then I heard her breath
break in a sob, and felt upon my hair the falling
of a tear.</p>
<p><i>August 5.</i> I am homesick to-night and tired.
It is ten-thirty, and, I have just gotten dinner.
I forgot all about it before. The story is moving
swiftly. It is nearly finished now, moreover
it is good; I know it. I sent a big roll of
manuscript to him to-day. He is at the coast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
and polishes the rough draft as fast as I send
it in. He tells me he has secured a publisher,
and that the book will be out in a few months.
I can hardly wait to finish, for then I, too, can
leave town. I will not go before; I have work
to do, and can do it better here. He tells me
he has seen her several times. God! a man who
writes novels and can mention her incidentally,
as though speaking of a dinner-party!</p>
<p><i>August 30.</i> I finished to-day and expressed
him the last scrap of copy. I wanted to sing, I
was so happy. Then I bethought me, it is her
birthday. I went down town and picked out
a stone that pleased me. Their messenger will
deliver it, and she can choose her own setting.
How I&#8217;d like to carry it myself, but I have a
little more work to do before I go. Only two
more days, and then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I have been counting the time since she left:
almost two months; it seems incredible when I
think of it.</p>
<p>How I have worked! Next time I write,
my journal confessor, I will have something to
tell: I will have seen her&ndash;&ndash;she who wears my
ring.... Ah! here comes my man for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
orders. A few of my bachelor friends help me
celebrate here to-night. I have not told them
it is the last time.</p>
<p><i>September 5.</i> Let me think; I am confused.
This hotel is vile, abominable, but there is no
other. That cursed odor of stale tobacco, and
of cookery!</p>
<p>The landlord says they were here yesterday
and went West. It&#8217;s easy to trace them&ndash;&ndash;everybody
notices. A tall man, dark, with a
firm jaw; the most beautiful woman they have
ever seen&ndash;&ndash;they all say the same. My God!
and I&#8217;m hung up here, inactive a whole day!
But I&#8217;ll find them, they can&#8217;t escape; and then
they&#8217;ll laugh at me, probably.</p>
<p>What can I do? I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t
think. I must find them first ... that
cursed odor again!</p>
<p>Oh, what a child, a worse than fool I have
been! To sit there in town pouring the best
work of my life into his hands! I must have
that book, I will have it. To think how I
trusted her&ndash;&ndash;waited until my hair began to
turn&ndash;&ndash;for this!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span></p>
<p>But I must stop. This is useless, it&#8217;s madness.</p>
<p><i>September 9.</i> It is a beautiful night. I have
just come in from a long walk, how long I
don&#8217;t know. I went to the suburbs and through
the parks, watching the young people sitting,
two and two, in the shadow. I smiled at the
sight, for in fancy I could hear what they were
saying. Then I wandered over to the lakefront
and stood a long time, with the waves
lapping musically against the rocks below, and
the moonlight glistening on a million reflectors.
The great stretch of water in front, and the
great city behind me sang low in concord, while
the stars looked down smiling at the refrain.
&#8220;Be calm, little mortal, be calm,&#8221; they said;
&#8220;calm, tiny mortal, calm,&#8221; repeated endlessly,
until the mood took hold of me, and in sympathy
I smiled in return.</p>
<p>Was it yesterday? It seems a month since
I found them. Was it I who was so hot and
angry? I hold up my hand; it is as steady as
my mother&#8217;s when, years ago, as a boy, she
laid it on my forehead with her good-night.
The murmur of this big hotel speaks soothingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
like the voice of an old friend. The purr of the
elevator is a voice I know. It all seems incredible.
To-day is so commonplace and real, and
yesterday so remote and fantastic.</p>
<p>He was lounging in the lobby, a hand in
either pocket, when I touched him on the
shoulder. He turned, but neither hands nor
face failed him by a motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume you would prefer to talk in
private?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you come to my
room?&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile formed slowly over his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to deprive my&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused,
and his eyes met mine,&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;my wife of a pleasant
chat with an old friend. I would suggest
that you come with us to our suite.&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded. In silence we went up the elevator;
in equal silence, he leading, we passed
along the corridor over carpets that gave out no
telltale sound.</p>
<p>She was standing by the window when we
entered. Her profile stood out clear in the
shaded room, and in spite of myself a great
heart-throb passed over me. She did not move
at first, but at last turning she saw him and me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
Then I could see her tremble; she started
quickly to leave, but he barred the way. The
smile was still upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, my dear,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;but
certainly you recognize an old friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grew white to the lips, and her eyes
blazed. Her hands pressed together so tightly
that the fingers became blue at the nails. She
looked at him; such scorn I had never seen
before. Before it, the smile slowly left his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you the fraction of a man,&#8221; she voiced
slowly, icily, &#8220;you would have stopped short
of&ndash;&ndash;this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a motion of her hand, so slight one
could scarce see it, and without a word he
stepped aside. She turned toward me and, instinctively,
I bent in courtesy, my eyes on the
floor and a great tumult in my heart. She hesitated
at passing me; without looking up I knew
it; then, slowly, moved away down the corridor.</p>
<p>I advanced inside, closing the door behind me
and snapping the lock. Neither of us said a
word; no word was needed. The fighting-blood
of each was up, and on each the square jaw that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
marked us both was set hard. I stepped up
within a yard of him and looked him square in
the eye. I pray God I may never be so angry
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What explanation have you to offer?&#8221; I
asked.</p>
<p>His eye never wavered, though the blood left
his face and lip; even then I admired his nerve.
When he spoke his voice was even and natural.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;You have lost;
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick as thought, I threw back the taunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost the woman, yes, thank God; the book,
never. I came for that, not for her. I demand
that you turn over the copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the cool smile and the steady voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a trifle late. I haven&#8217;t a sheet; it
is all gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; I flung the hot words fair in
his teeth.</p>
<p>A smile, mocking, maddening, formed upon
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you before you had lost. The book
is copyrighted&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a pause, while the smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
broadened&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;copyrighted in my name, and
sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instinct of battle, primitive, uncontrollable,
came over me and the room turned dark.
I fought it, until my hands grew greasy from
the wounds where the nails bit my palms, then
I lost control; of what follows all is confused.</p>
<p>I dimly see myself leaping at him like a wild
animal; I feel the tightening of the big neck
muscles as my fingers closed on his throat; I
feel a soft breath of night air as we neared the
open window; then in my hands a sudden lightness,
and in my ears a cry of terror.</p>
<p>I awoke at a pounding on the door. It
seemed hours later, though it must have been
but seconds. I arose&ndash;&ndash;and was alone. The
window was wide open; in the street below,
a crowd was gathering on the run, while a policeman&#8217;s
shrill whistle rang out on the night.
A hundred faces were turned toward me as I
looked down and I dimly wondered thereat.</p>
<p>The knocking on the door became more insistent.
I turned the lock, slowly, and a woman
rushed into the room. Something about her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
seemed familiar to me. I passed my hand over
my forehead&ndash;&ndash;but it was useless. I bowed
low and started to walk out, but she seized me
by the arm, calling my name, pleadingly. Her
soft brown hair was all loose and hanging,
and her big eyes swimming; her whole body
trembled so that she could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>The grip of the white hand on my arm
tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You must not go,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;you
cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried gently to shake her off, but she clung
more closely than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must let me explain,&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;I
call God to witness, I was not to blame.&#8221; She
drew a case from the bosom of her dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are those stones; I never wore them.
I wanted to, God knows, but I couldn&#8217;t. Take
them, I beg of you.&#8221; She thrust the case into
my pocket. &#8220;He made me take them, you
understand; made me do everything from the
first. I loved him once, long ago, and since
then I couldn&#8217;t get away. I can&#8217;t explain.&#8221;
She was pleading as I never heard woman plead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
before. &#8220;Forgive me&ndash;&ndash;tell me you forgive
me&ndash;&ndash;speak to me.&#8221; The grip on my arm loosened
and her voice dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! God, to have brought this on you when
I loved you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words sounded in my ears, but made no
impression. It all seemed very, very strange.
Why should she say such things to me? She
must be mistaken&ndash;&ndash;must take me for another.</p>
<p>I broke away from her grasp, and groped
staggeringly toward the door. A weariness intense
was upon me and I wanted to be home
alone. As I moved away, I heard behind me
a swift step as though she would follow, and my
name called softly, then another movement,
away.</p>
<p>Mechanically I turned at the sound, and saw
her profile standing clear in the open window-frame.
Realization came to me with a mighty
rush, and with a cry that was a great sob I
sprang toward her.</p>
<p>Suddenly the window became clear again,
and through the blackness that formed about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
me I dimly heard a great wail of horror arise
from the street below.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There was no other entry save the hasty
scrawl in pencil.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
<a name='THE_TOUCH_HUMAN' id='THE_TOUCH_HUMAN'></a>
<h2>THE TOUCH HUMAN</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221; A lingering of finger
tips that touched, as by accident; a bared
head; the regular tap of shoes on cement, as a
man walked down the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night&ndash;&ndash;and God bless thee,&#8221; he repeated
softly, tenderly, under his breath, that
none but he might hear: words of faith spoken
reverently, and by one who believes not in the
God known of the herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night&ndash;&ndash;and God bless thee,&#8221; whispered
the woman slowly; and the south wind,
murmuring northward, took the words and
carried them gently away as sacred things.</p>
<p>The woman stood thinking, dreaming, her
color mounting, her eyes dimming, as she read
deep the mystery of her own heart.</p>
<p>They had sat side by side the entire evening,
and had talked of life and of its hidden things;
or else had remained silent in the unspoken converse
that is even sweeter to those who understand
each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>She had said of a mutual friend: &#8220;He is a
man I admire; he has an ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A thing but few of earth possess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I think you are wrong. I believe all
people have ideals. They must; life would not
be life without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean object rather than ideal. Does
not an ideal mean something beautiful&ndash;&ndash;something
beyond&ndash;&ndash;something we&#8217;d give our all
for? Not our working hours alone, but our
hours of pleasure and our times of thought. An
ideal is an intangible thing&ndash;&ndash;having much of
the supernatural in its make-up; &#8217;tis a fetish for
which we&#8217;d sacrifice life&ndash;&ndash;or the strongest passion
of life,&ndash;&ndash;love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this an ideal, though? Could anything
be beautiful to us after we&#8217;d sacrificed much of
life, and all of love in its attainment? Is not
everything that is opposed to love also opposed
to the ideal? Is not an ideal, when all is told,
nothing but a great love&ndash;&ndash;the great personal
love of each individual?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the woman, and there was that
in his face which caused her eyes to drop, and
her breath to come more quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m miserable, and lonely,
and tired. I&#8217;ve thought I had an ideal, and I
followed it, working for it faithfully and for it
alone. I&#8217;ve shown it to myself, glowing, splendid,
when I became weary and ready to yield.
I&#8217;ve sacrificed, in attempting its attainment,
youth and pleasure&ndash;&ndash;self, continually. Still,
I&#8217;m afar off&ndash;&ndash;and still the light beckons me
on. I work day after day, and night after
night, as ever; but the faith within me is growing
weaker. Might not the ideal I worshipped
after all be an earth-born thing, an ambition
whose brightness is not of pure gold, but of
tinsel? That which I have sought, speaks
always to me so loudly that there may be no
mistake in hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am thy god,&#8217; it says; &#8216;worship me&ndash;&ndash;and
me alone. Sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;sacrifice&ndash;&ndash;thyself&ndash;&ndash;thy
love. Thus shalt thou attain me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;One day I stopped my work to think; hid
myself solitary that I might question. &#8216;What
shall I have when I attain thee?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fame&ndash;&ndash;fame&ndash;&ndash;the plaudits of the people&ndash;&ndash;a
pedestal apart.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; whispered my soul to me, &#8216;and a
great envy always surrounding; a great fight
always to hold thy small pedestal secure.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of such as this are ideals made? No. &#8217;Twas
a mistake. I have sought not an ideal, but an
ambition&ndash;&ndash;a worthless thing. An ideal is
something beautiful&ndash;&ndash;a great love. &#8217;Tis not
yet too late to correct my fault; to seek this
ideal&ndash;&ndash;this beautiful thing&ndash;&ndash;this love.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached over to the woman and their
fingers, as by chance, touching, lingered together.
His eyes shone, and when he spoke his
voice trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> know the ideal&ndash;&ndash;the beautiful thing&ndash;&ndash;the
love I seek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Side by side they sat, each bosom throbbing;
not with the wild passion of youth, but with the
deeper, more spiritual love of middle-life.
Overhead, the night wind murmured; all about,
the crickets sang.</p>
<p>Turning, she met him face to face, frankly,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us think.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, in her eyes the look men worship
and, worshipping, find oblivion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></p>
<p>A moment they stood together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; his lips silently answered,
pressing upon hers.</p>

<h2>A DARK HORSE</h2>
</div>
<p>Iowa City is not large, nor are the prospects
for metropolitan greatness at all flattering.
Even her most zealous citizen, the
ancient of the market corner, admits that
&#8220;there ain&#8217;t been much stirrin&#8217; for quite a spell
back,&#8221; and among the broad fraternity of commercial
travellers, the town is a standing joke.
Yet, throughout the entire State, no community
of equal size is so well known. It is the home
of the State University.</p>
<p>In the year &#8217;90-something-or-other, there was
enrolled in the junior class of the university,
one Walter R. Chester, but it is doubtful
whether five other students in the same classic
seat of learning could have told you his given
name. Away back in his freshman year he had
been dubbed &#8220;Lord&#8221; Chester. And as &#8220;Lord&#8221;
Chester alone is his name still preserved, and
revered in university annals.</p>
<p>The reasons lying back of this exaltation to
the peerage were not very complex, but quite as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
adequate as those usually inspiring college
nicknames. He was known to be country-bred,
and the average freshwater school defines
the &#8220;country&#8221; as a region of dense mental
darkness, commencing where the campus ends
and extending thence in every direction,
throughout the unchartered realms of space.</p>
<p>Each Friday afternoon, &#8220;Lord&#8221; Chester
would carefully lock his room and disappear
upon a bicycle; this much was plainly visible
to everybody. On Monday he would reappear.
The hiatus afforded a peg from which much
unprofitable speculation was suspended. The
argument most plausible was that he went
home, while one romantic youth suggested a
girl. The accusation was never repeated.
What? The &#8220;Lord&#8221; a ladies&#8217; man? Tut!
One would as soon expect a statue to drill a
minstrel show.</p>
<p>Thus Chester&#8217;s personal affairs remained a
mystery. He never talked reflexively&ndash;&ndash;rare
attribute in a college man&ndash;&ndash;and, moreover,
curiosity never throve well in his presence. It
utterly failed to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity distinguished him from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
all the rest of the student body: he roomed by
himself. Although invariably courteous and
polite to visitors, he was never known to extend
an invitation for a second visit. He quite obviously
wanted to be left alone, and the &#8220;fellows&#8221;
met him more than half-way.</p>
<p>But what, more than anything else, probably
helped to designate him &#8220;Lord,&#8221; was the scrupulous
way in which he dressed. There was no
hint of the pastoral in his sartorial accomplishments,
and it was his one extravagance. Though
from the country and therefore presumably
poor, no swell son of the Western <i>haute monde</i>
made an equally smart appearance.</p>
<p>We have been viewing the youth from the
standpoint of his fellow-students. As a matter
of fact, they never saw the real man, the man
behind the closed door, at all. He was a terrific
worker. When he decided to do a thing, he did
it. Night was as day at such times, and meals
were unthought of. He literally plunged out
of sight into his work, and as yet he had never
failed.</p>
<p>One reason for this uniform success lay in the
fact that he was able to define his limitations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
and never attempted the impossible. He was,
indeed, poor; that is, relatively so. His earliest
recollections were associated with corn rows
and grilling suns; which accounted for the
present cheerfulness with which he tackled any
task, and for his appetite for hard work. When
tired, he would think of the weight of a hoe in a
boy&#8217;s hand at six o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and
proceed with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>Such was &#8220;Lord&#8221; Chester: product of work
and solitude; a man who knew more about the
ideal than the real; a man who would never
forget a friend nor forgive an injury; who
would fight to the bitter end and die game&ndash;&ndash;hero
of &#8220;<i>the</i>&#8221; Marathon, whose exciting history
is impossible to avoid in Iowa City.</p>
<p>By nature, Chester was an athlete, and by
way of exercise he was accustomed to indulge
in a few turns daily upon the cinder path.
One evening in early spring he was jogging
along at a steady brisk pace, when two men in
training-suits caught up with him. They were
puffing when they fell in beside him. Presently
they dropped behind, and one, a tall important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
youth, of the name of Richards, called
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, me lud, aren&#8217;t you going to clear the
trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick as a shot Chester halted and faced
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>The other two nearly bumped into him, but
managed to come to a standstill, before precipitating
that catastrophe. They lurched
back upon their heels, nearly toppling backwards,
too surprised for the moment to speak.
Chester did not stir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jiminy crickets!&#8221; Richards&#8217; companion exclaimed
in a moment. &#8220;You&#8217;re deuced sudden,
Chester, I must say.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Richards&#8217; manner promptly grew conciliatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; he said, smiling, &#8220;you really
ought to train. You&#8217;ve got form&ndash;&ndash;by George,
you have! Besides, you wouldn&#8217;t have any
opposition to speak of, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richards was still smiling; but a smile, however
warmly encouraged from within, is apt to
take cold in a frost. The casual glance with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
which Chester took in the young man, from his
light sprinting-pumps to his eyes, may be accurately
described as frigid. Not until he had
held the other&#8217;s embarrassed look for an appreciable
pause did he deign to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;There really ought to be,&#8221; he said without
emotion, &#8220;at least one man in the field. I think
I shall train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it came about that &#8220;Lord&#8221; Chester
decided to enter athletics. Five minutes previously
even the thought had not occurred to
him; but he wasn&#8217;t the man to quail before a
bluff.</p>
<p>The track management of this particular
university was an oligarchy; was governed by a
few absolute individuals. Perhaps such a condition
is not as rare as might be supposed.
However that may be, it was here a case of
being either &#8220;in&#8221; or &#8220;out.&#8221; Chester was unpopular,
and from the first had been out.</p>
<p>There were only four entries for the running
events, the same names appearing in all; so he
could not be kept from the field. But he well
knew that various ways existed by which favoritism
could be shown, and that these preferences,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
too trifling in themselves to warrant complaint,
might prove a serious handicap in a close
contest. He knew that, however honors might
lie among the other entries, they would hesitate
at nothing to prevent him from taking a
place. In fact, Richards openly boasted that
he would pocket &#8220;&#8217;is ludship&#8221; at the finish.</p>
<p>So Chester shaped his plans accordingly.
He had never aimed at the impossible, nor did
he now. He withdrew from all short-distance
runs and yard dashes, and concentrated his
mind upon the Marathon&ndash;&ndash;thus dignified, although
the faculty would permit nothing more
arduous than two miles.</p>
<p>In saying trained, everything is meant that
the word can be made to imply: the sort of hour
in, hour out, to-the-limit-of-endurance training
which either makes or kills. A fortnight before
Field Day Chester was in perfect condition,
and had his capabilities gauged to a nicety. He
was now entered only in the Marathon; they
virtually had forced him from the half-mile,
and they should be made to pay the penalty.</p>
<p>One day before the race Chester went to
the bank and inquired the amount of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
balance. It was shown him: one hundred and
six dollars and some odd cents. He drew a
cheque for the amount, and thrust the bills into
his pocket. From the bank he walked straight
up Main Street for three blocks, then turned in
at a well-kept brick house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Richards in?&#8221; he asked of the servant-girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Right upstairs&ndash;&ndash;second door to
the left. He&#8217;s got company now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The junior nevertheless resolutely mounted
the stairs and knocked upon the door. The
noise inside resembled a pocket-edition of the
Chicago Board of Trade, so Chester hammered
again, louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; some one yelled, and the noise
subsided.</p>
<p>He opened the door and stepped inside. A
half-dozen young fellows were scattered about,
but as he knew none of them, except by name,
he ignored their presence and walked directly
up to Richards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come on business,&#8221; he said; &#8220;can I
speak with you a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; Richards removed his feet from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
chair, kicking it at the same time toward his
visitor. &#8220;These fellows know more about my
business now than I do myself, so get it off of
your chest, Chester.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company laughed, but Chester remained
wholly unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said he, calmly. &#8220;You&#8217;re in the
Marathon: want to risk anything on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Up went Richards&#8217; feet once more, this time
to a table. He winked broadly at his friends,
and replied with an air of vast carelessness,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;yes; I don&#8217;t mind. Guess I can
cover you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; demanded Chester. &#8220;Odds
even, mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d cover you, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; with some
warmth. Richards fumbled in his trousers
pockets, extracting therefrom a handful of
loose change.</p>
<p>Chester advanced to the table. At sight of
his roll of bills a sudden silence fell. All eyes
were glued upon them while he counted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five&ndash;&ndash;ten&ndash;&ndash;fifteen&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and so on, up to
one hundred. He stowed the remaining five
back in his pocket, pushed the pile into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
middle of the table and looked coolly down at
his host. Said he,</p>
<p>&#8220;One hundred, even, that I win the Marathon.
Cover, or show these fellows the sort of
piker you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Richards came very near to showing
them. His face was a study. He hadn&#8217;t ten
dollars to his name; he was painfully aware of
the fact, and here were these six boys who would
know it too in about two seconds. He was rattled,
and sat looking at the pile of bills as
though charmed. He racked his brain for some
way out of the predicament, but the only thing
he could think of was to wonder whether the
portrait on the top note was that of Hendricks
or Rufus Choate. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be Choate,&#8221; suddenly
occurred to him. &#8220;But then it&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a laugh in the back of the room.
Richards stood up. A dozen fire alarms would
not have recalled him so quickly. Whatever
else might be said of the man he was game, and
now his gameness showed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me an hour; I&#8217;ll meet you then in
front of the postoffice.&#8221; While speaking he
had gotten into his coat; now he walked toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
the door. &#8220;Amuse yourselves while I&#8217;m gone,
fellows,&#8221; he said, and disappeared down the
stairway.</p>
<p>Chester replaced the notes in his pocket,
nodded gravely to the company and followed.</p>
<p>Not a boy spoke, but all sat staring blankly
at the doorway.</p>
<p>An hour later, both Richards and Chester appeared
at the postoffice. The former, by dint
of much persistent circulation among his fellow
athletes, had found enough of them who were
willing to pool their funds in order to secure the
necessary amount. The two young men had
witnesses, the wager was properly closed and
the money deposited. Neither spoke an unnecessary
word during the meeting, but when
Chester started to leave, Richards turned facetiously
to his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Is bloomin&#8217; ludship will start training Friday;
bet he has his wheel in soak.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which remark Chester paid not the
slightest attention.</p>
<p>Whatever may be said to the contrary, six
boys can no more retain a secret than can six
girls, and inside of an hour the story of the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
bet had spread over the town. In due course it
penetrated to the city: one day a reporter appeared
and interviewed the principals, and
on the following Sunday their photographs
adorned the pink section of a great daily. This
was nuts for the university&ndash;&ndash;but it is getting
ahead of our own story somewhat.</p>
<p>Chester, naturally, was the centre of curiosity.
He had not pawned his &#8220;bike,&#8221; as was
demonstrated when Friday rolled around; but
had it been known that the last cent he owned
in the world had been staked upon the issue, no
doubt the interest would have been greater.</p>
<p>Field Day opened bright and clear, and early
in the afternoon Athletic Park began to fill. A
rumor had gone abroad that the two principal
competitors had actually come to blows, and
that each had sworn to die rather than lose the
race. Long before the opening event the inclosure
was crowded with spectators, all eagerly
discussing the Marathon, to the exclusion of
every other contest. The opinion was freely
expressed that Richards would &#8220;put a crimp in
that chesty Chester,&#8221; and that he would &#8220;win
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
in a walk.&#8221; They made no bones about playing
favorites.</p>
<p>It was a still, hot day, and if there is any advantage
in atmospheric conditions each contestant
should have been inspired with that absolute
confidence of winning, without which the
fastest race is but a tame affair. At two o&#8217;clock
the band commenced playing. The judges
tried to follow the programme, but the cries of
&#8220;Marathon! Marathon!&#8221; grew so insistent and
clamorous that they finally yielded, and the
event was called.</p>
<p>Richards responded first. He was popular,
and the grandstand gave him an ovation as he
took his position under the wire. It seemed as
though the handkerchief of every girl present
was in the air. The two figureheads, friends of
Richards, came next, and last of all Chester.</p>
<p>A feeble attempt at applause marked his passage
in front of the grandstand; but he never
looked up, and for any indication he gave to
the contrary, he might have been the only person
on the grounds. His track suit was hidden by
a long black door curtain, in lieu of a bath-robe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
and a pretty girl on the front row remarked
audibly, &#8220;He&#8217;s all ready for the funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; answered her companion.
&#8220;He knows his obsequies are about to take
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peels well,&#8221; a man by the rail critically
commented. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;rats!&ndash;&ndash;Richards has
pocketed this event ever since he&#8217;s been here;
you can&#8217;t make the pace for him with anything
slower than an auto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The runners were in line at last, crouching
low, tense, finger-tips upon the ground, the
starting-pistol above their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starters ready?&#8221; floated in a sing-song
voice from the judges&#8217; stand. &#8220;Timers r-r-read-y-y?&#8221;
A sharp crack from the pistol, and
they were off.</p>
<p>Then a queer thing happened. Instead of
dawdling along behind, as every one expected,
Chester, without an instant&#8217;s hesitation, pushed
to the front and set the pace.</p>
<p>And what a pace! It was literally a race
from the word go. Chester took the inside and
faced the music, Richards and the others close
in behind. Sympathy in the grandstand was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
beginning to turn; everybody appreciates
pluck. The spectators, however, knew him to
be a novice, and many supposed that he had
lost his head; so when he passed the grandstand
on the first lap, any amount of contradictory
advice was shouted noisily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them set the pace!&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re killing
yourself!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, you bally Lord!&ndash;&ndash;go it,
kid!&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em nose you out, Chester,
old scout!&#8221; &#8220;Save your air, old top, you&#8217;ll
need it!&#8221; and much more of a like kind was
hurled at him, which reached his ears through
the veil of singing wind, like the roar of distant
breakers upon the seashore.</p>
<p>He kept his own counsel. He had followed
that pace every day during the last two weeks
of his training, and he knew precisely what he
could do. Besides the air was quiet, and the
disadvantage of being pace-maker was not so
great as people thought.</p>
<p>In this formation they came round the half-mile
oval the second time, each man working
with the nice regularity of well-oiled machinery.
Not a sound now from the grandstand; only
the soft <i>pat</i> of the runners&#8217; feet could be heard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
The crowd had caught Chester&#8217;s idea: but could
he hold out?</p>
<p>They had passed the three-quarter pole on
the third lap when a yell went up, and everybody
rose excitedly to their feet. Space was
growing rapidly between the leaders and those
behind; it was now resolved to a duel between
the principals.</p>
<p>As they dashed past, the crowd examined
them closely, scores of field-glasses being
trained upon them like so many guns.</p>
<p>Chester was still erect, his head well back,
chest forward, arms working piston-like, close
down at his sides, while his long, regular tread
was as light and springy as an Indian&#8217;s. His
jaw was set grimly, but it was manifest that he
was still breathing deep and regularly through
his nostrils.</p>
<p>It was equally manifest that his opponent
was in distress. The last of his strength and
determination was dying away in a desperate
effort to keep his pace; his face was colorless,
eyes staring, his step irregular. Worst of all,
his mouth was open, and his chest could be seen
to vibrate as he panted.</p>

He heard a voice ... and glanced back.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></div>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; muttered the man at the rail,
as amazed as though the blue canopy of heaven
had suddenly fallen, &#8220;Chester&#8217;ll take it, I do
believe!&#8221; And the crowd was beginning to
believe the same.</p>
<p>The rivals maintained their relative positions
until, on the last lap, the three-quarter pole was
once more reached. The two figureheads had
dropped out and mounted a fence where they
would not be too far away from the finish.</p>
<p>Every eye was trained upon the racers, the
excitement was tense. Chester was pounding
grimly away; sweat was pouring down his face
until it glistened in the sun; his legs ached as
though in a boot of torture. But he had no
thought of allowing Richards to close the gap
between them by an inch. He was counting the
<i>pat-pat-pat!</i> of his feet upon the track.
&#8220;Seventy-three more, and it&#8217;s won, old boy,&#8221;
he muttered. He could hear Richards&#8217; every
breath. &#8220;One, two, three,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he counted.</p>
<p>He heard a voice, so broken that the words
could hardly be distinguished, and he glanced
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;sake, Chester&ndash;&ndash;hold&ndash;&ndash;up!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
gasped Richards. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t lose&ndash;&ndash;this race&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a pitiable figure, his white face drawn
in lines of pain, his body swaying uncertainly,
as he pressed despairingly on.</p>
<p>For one moment Chester&#8217;s heart felt a throb
of pity. Then he thought of his work in sun
and rain; of Richards&#8217; contempt in the past; of
the cheers for his rival and the open ridicule of
his own pretensions; and last of all, but far
from being the least consideration, the two hundred
dollars absolutely necessary to carry him
through his final year to graduation.</p>
<p>Ah, nobody knew about that two hundred
dollars, save himself and one little girl, who
had driven into town early in the afternoon,
and who had slipped timidly into as good a seat
as she could find in the stand. She showed one
dot of pink among hundreds of fluffy white
gowns; Chester was ignorant of her presence,
but as he sped round and round the track, her
eyes never once left him, nor did she cease praying
silently that he might win!</p>
<p>Only for an instant did he hesitate; then his
face settled into an expression not pleasant to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
look upon. He forgot that he was tired, that
a grandstand full of howling maniacs was
ahead of him. He thought only of the girl in
pink&ndash;&ndash;and made his spurt.</p>
<p>Richards tried to follow, but a haze was
forming over his eyes. His heart was pounding
until he believed that he must suffocate.
Then he reeled suddenly, lost his balance and
fell into darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is victory!&#8221; murmured Chester to
himself a moment later, as he swayed unsteadily
upon the shoulders of a howling mob.
He was thinking of poor Richards lying back
there upon the track. But just then he espied
the transfigured face of the girl in pink.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is! It is!&#8221; he shouted joyfully.</p>

<h2>THE WORTH OF THE PRICE</h2>
</div>
<p>Nobody in a normal humor would dispute
the fact that Clementine Willis was
a strikingly handsome girl. One might even be
moved, by a burst of enthusiasm, to declare her
beautiful. There was about her that subtle,
elusive charm of perfection in minute detail,
possible only to the wealthy who can discriminate
between art and that which is artificial, and
who can take advantage of all of art&#8217;s magic
resources, without imparting the slightest suggestion
of artificiality.</p>
<p>Her hair and eyes were dark&ndash;&ndash;very dark;
her skin bore the matchless, transparent tint of
ivory; every line of her high-bred face, and of
her hands and her slender, arched feet, bespoke
the ultimate degree of refinement.</p>
<p>She was the sort of girl, in short, that a full-blooded
man must needs stare at, perhaps furtively,
but with no thought of boldness. Stupid,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
indeed, must be he who would attempt anything
even remotely approaching familiarity with
Miss Willis.</p>
<p>Her smart brougham waits in front of a new
and resplendent down-town office building on
a certain afternoon, while Miss Willis ascends
in one of the elevators to the tenth floor. She
proceeds with assurance, but leisurely&ndash;&ndash;mayhap
she is a trifle bored&ndash;&ndash;to a door which somehow
manages to convey an impression of prosperity
beyond. It bears upon its frosted glass
the name of Dr. Leonard, a renowned specialist
in diseases of the throat, besides the names of a
half-dozen assistants&ndash;&ndash;in much smaller lettering&ndash;&ndash;who,
doubtless, are in the ferment of
struggling for positions of equal renown.</p>
<p>The door opening discloses a neat, uniformed
maid and a large and richly furnished reception-room.
Five ladies, of various ages and all handsomely
gowned, are seated here and there, manifestly
forcing patience to relieve the <i>ennui</i>
which would have been tolerated with no other
detail of the day&#8217;s routine.</p>
<p>This cursory survey is sufficient, it is hoped,
to demonstrate that Dr. Leonard&#8217;s practice is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
confined among a class of which most other
practitioners might be pardonably envious.</p>
<p>The white-aproned, white-capped maid
smiled a polite recognition of the newest
arrival. A bit flustered by the calmly impersonal
scrutiny with which her greeting was received,
she addressed Miss Willis in a subdued
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was to tell you, Miss Willis, that there is
no occasion for Dr. Leonard to see you himself
to-day. If you please, Dr. Carter will fill your
engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Willis did not please. It was quite
clear that she regarded this arrangement with
considerable disfavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may inform Dr. Leonard that I shall
not wait,&#8221; she said coldly. &#8220;If I am so far improved
that I do not require his personal attention,
I shall not come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, she turned decisively to leave.
The maid followed her, hesitantly, to the door,
and Miss Willis could not repress a smile at the
girl&#8217;s consternation. The situation had ended
in an altogether unexpected manner. And then,
in the next instant, it became manifest that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
however absolute Dr. Leonard might be, it was
not a part of the maid&#8217;s duties to discourage
those who would seek his services. She was
emboldened to protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try him, please, Miss Willis,&#8221; in a
nervous murmur; &#8220;he&ndash;&ndash;truly&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The assurance was left unfinished; but the
speaker&#8217;s flurry revealed her predicament, and
Miss Willis smiled encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she returned graciously.</p>
<p>The maid gave her a grateful look and conducted
her though several rooms, all in accord
with the sumptuous reception-room, to a tiny
private office, where she opened the door and
stood respectfully on one side.</p>
<p>The visitor&#8217;s submissive mood all at once
vanished. She stared resentfully at the
cramped quarters, and entered reluctantly, as
if with a feeling of being thrust willy-nilly into
a labelled pill-box. A man was writing at a
desk in a corner, and he continued writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a chair, please,&#8221; he said crisply, without
looking up. And this was the only sign to
indicate that he was aware that his privacy had
been invaded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></p>
<p>Miss Willis&#8217;s dark eyes flashed. She seemed
about to make an indignant rejoinder, but
thought better of it. She ignored the invitation
to sit down, however, and by and by the circumstance
caught the writer&#8217;s attention; he
bent a quick, surprised look round at her&ndash;&ndash;then
proceeded with his writing. He did not repeat
the request.</p>
<p>He presently finished his task, noted the
time, and made an entry upon a tabulated sheet
beside him; he then filed the memorandum upon
a hook, and swung round in his chair, facing the
intruder&ndash;&ndash;for such the girl felt herself to be.</p>
<p>Fortunately Miss Willis was not without a
sense of humor, and she was able to perceive
an amusing quality in her reception to-day.
Such supreme indifference to her very existence
was so wholly foreign to anything in her past
experience, that she was acutely sensible of its
freshness and novelty.</p>
<p>But now the man became all at once impressed
with the circumstance that she was still
standing, and he bounded guiltily to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221; he exclaimed in confusion.
&#8220;I was&ndash;&ndash;was very busy when you came in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
Won&#8217;t you please have this chair?&#8221; He awkwardly
shoved one forward.</p>
<p>The man was young; Miss Willis was unable
to determine whether he was good-looking, or
ugly; whether he was the right sort, or impossible;
so she accepted the proffered chair.</p>
<p>He resumed his own seat, and leaned one arm
wearily upon the desk. Already he had forgotten
his momentary embarrassment, and he
was now regarding the girl simply as a patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Leonard has given me the history of
your case,&#8221; he informed her in a matter of fact
way. &#8220;He requests that I continue with it&ndash;&ndash;unless,
of course, you prefer that he treat you
himself.&#8221; He got up as he spoke, and Miss
Willis decided that he was good-looking and
young, and that he was tall and of a figure to
appeal to the feminine eye.</p>
<p>Then she was guilty of a most reprehensible
act of slyness. She turned full upon him the
batteries of her lustrous dark eyes, and smiled
dazzlingly, bewitchingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to see Dr. Leonard,&#8221; she said in a
tone that made one think of dripping honey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
&#8220;And I object to being turned over to an
assistant&ndash;&ndash;at least before consulting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Utterly at variance with all precedent, the
bewitching look produced no effect whatever.
The man bowed gravely, pressed a bell-button,
and then went over to where Miss Willis was
sitting. Before he could speak&ndash;&ndash;if he had any
such intention&ndash;&ndash;a girl in starched cap and
apron appeared in answer to his ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Willis has concluded not to remain,&#8221;
he informed the maid. &#8220;Show Number
Twenty-seven into Room Four. Inform her
that I will see her in two minutes.&#8221; Producing
his watch, he deliberately marked the time.</p>
<p>He turned to Miss Willis in a moment, with
an air which said as plainly as words could have
said it: &#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible waste of precious time,
but if necessary I&#8217;ll sacrifice the two minutes
to humoring any further caprices you may
develop.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was too much for the young lady&#8217;s tranquillity:
she laughed, and laughed frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray tell me,&#8221; she managed to say, &#8220;what
<i>my</i> number is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span></p>
<p>Without the slightest alteration in his serious
mien, he consulted a list hanging beside his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven,&#8221; he announced at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; quickly. &#8220;Has there been some
mistake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;oh, no&#8221;; Miss Willis was now perfectly
composed. &#8220;I had a feeling, though,
that it must have been nearer seven thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be impossible, you know,&#8221; the man
patiently explained, &#8220;to see that many patients
in a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? How interesting!&#8221; Her irony
was unnoticed, and once more she laughed. To
tell the truth, if anybody could associate such a
frivolity with Miss Willis&#8217;s dignity, she giggled.</p>
<p>She contemplated the man with undisguised
curiosity. Naturally enough she had met more
men than she could even remember, but never
one anything like this particular specimen. To
add to her quickened interest, he was not only
positively good-looking, but every line of his
face, the poise of his well-proportioned, upstanding
figure, the tilt of his head and the
squareness of his chin, all spoke of strength; of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
elemental strength, and of a purposeful, resolute
character. And, too, she told herself that
he had nice eyes. The nice eyes never wavered
in their respectful regard of her.</p>
<p>He spoke again:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you that Dr. Leonard meant
no discourtesy. The new arrangement means
nothing further than that your trouble is more
distinctively within my province. It is his
custom, once he has thoroughly diagnosed a
case, to assign it to the one of his assistants best
qualified to treat it. Dr. Leonard is a very
busy man; he can&#8217;t be expected to do more than
supervise his aides.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now he was actually rebuking her!</p>
<p>He bowed once more, and moved toward the
door. His hand was upon the knob, when an
imperious command brought him to a standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Miss Willis. &#8220;Dr. Carter, if
I remain here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He coolly interrupted. &#8220;Pardon me, Miss
Willis, but my patient is waiting. I shall be at
liberty in ten minutes, then I shall return.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time he was gone.</p>
<p>Number Four must have been an adjoining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
room, for the next instant she could hear Dr.
Carter&#8217;s voice through the thin board partition.
His speech was as unemotional and businesslike
as when addressing her. She could not
make up her mind whether to go or wait, and
so sat pondering and presently forgot to go.</p>
<p>Here was a man such as she had never
dreamed of as existing; one absolutely disinterested,
who treated people&ndash;&ndash;even people like
Clementine Willis&ndash;&ndash;as abstractly as a master
mechanic goes about repairing a worn-out engine.
Perhaps it was a characteristically feminine
decision at which she presently arrived, but
anyway she made up her mind, then and there,
to know more of this man.</p>
<p>After a while Miss Willis fell to surveying
the room; with an undefined hope, perhaps, that
it would throw some further light upon the
young doctor&#8217;s character. It was essentially
the home of a busy man. Every article had a
use and a definite one. The spirit of the place
was contagious, and presently she began to
have a feeling that she was the one useless thing
there.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room was the desk where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
he had been writing, upon which was a pile of
loose manuscript. Reference books were scattered
all about, some with improvised bookmarks,
but mostly face downward, just as they
had been left. The environment was that of
one who seeks to overtake and outstrip Time,
rather than to forget him.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter returned at last, entering quickly
but quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon my leaving you so abruptly,&#8221; he
apologized, the impersonal note again in his
voice, and an inquiry as well. He seemed surprised
that she had not departed.</p>
<p>The girl was manifestly at a loss for words;
this was such an extraordinary predicament for
her to find herself in that she determined to say
something at any cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Carter,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;have
changed my mind; I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;wish you to continue
my treatment&ndash;&ndash;if you will.&#8221; It was not
at all what she had intended saying, and she
was chagrined to feel her cheeks grow suddenly
hot; she knew that they must be rosy.</p>
<p>It was likely that young Dr. Carter was unused
to smiling; but suddenly his eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
alight. He spoke, and the dry, impersonal note
was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We hard-working
doctors can stand almost anything&ndash;&ndash;without
caring a snap of our fingers, too&ndash;&ndash;but when it
comes to doubting or questioning&ndash;&ndash;not <i>our</i>
methods, but those that have been tried and
proven, and of which we merely avail ourselves,&ndash;&ndash;why,
we can&#8217;t be expected to waste much
sympathy on the scoffers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rang the inevitable bell, and gave word to
the maid: &#8220;Tell Dr. Leonard that Miss Willis
has decided to continue her treatment
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, in the light of the foregoing experience,
it was strange that during the next week Miss
Willis&#8217;s throat should require considerably more
attention than it ever had under the celebrated
specialist&#8217;s personal ministrations. She made
five visits to Dr. Carter, but it could not be said
that he had advanced an inch toward the opening
she had made. His voice and manner were
a bit more sympathetic&ndash;&ndash;and that was all.</p>
<p>Miss Willis seemed to find a keen delight in
the fact that her identity, for the time being,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
was erased by a number; during each visit she
made it a point to learn what this number was,
treating the matter in a sportive spirit, unbending
her wit to ridicule a practice which failed to
discriminate among the host of patients who
came to see Dr. Leonard.</p>
<p>&#8220;For our purposes,&#8221; Dr. Carter tolerantly
explained, &#8220;a number more conveniently identifies
our patients; their differences are only
pathological. A name is easily forgotten, Miss
Willis, unless there is some unusual circumstance
associated with it, to impress it upon the
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was curious to learn what unusual circumstance
had caused him to retain her name,
but lacked the temerity to ask. She would have
been amazed, unbelieving, had he told her that
it was her beauty; that he was clinging rather
desperately to the unlovely number, which had
no individuality and whose features were altogether
neutral and negative.</p>
<p>The change in his manner, when it came,
almost took away her breath. It was on the occasion
of her last visit. After the familiar preliminary
examination, instead of proceeding at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
once with the treatment, as had been his invariable
custom, Dr. Carter walked over to his desk
and sat down. For a space he soberly regarded
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Willis,&#8221; said he, presently, &#8220;there is
nothing whatever the matter with your throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gasped. This calm statement brought
confusingly to her mind the circumstance that
she had forgotten her throat and its ailment,
when, of all considerations, the afflicted member
should have been uppermost in her mind. Dr.
Carter had not, however, and he must be wondering
why she continued to come after the occasion
to do so no longer existed. He at once
relieved her embarrassment, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, and she felt a thrill at
the note of regret in his voice, &#8220;that you will be
glad to escape from this hive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, with unnecessary
warmth. This involuntary denial surprised
even herself, and she blushed.</p>
<p>The smile left Dr. Carter&#8217;s lips, but he said
nothing&ndash;&ndash;merely sat looking at her in his
grave way.</p>
<p>Here was to be another period, which Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
Willis could look back upon as one of temporary
inability to find words. She started to
leave, furious with herself for her inaptness,
and instead of going she paused and turned
back.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter had risen; he was standing as she
had left him. She drew a card from her cardcase.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think what you please of me,
Dr. Carter,&#8221; she said with sudden impulse, extending
the card and meeting his look steadily,
&#8220;but I would be glad if you were to call.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to take him a long time to read the
address. All at once his hands were trembling,
and when he looked up the expression in the
gray eyes brought a swift tide of color to the
girl&#8217;s face, where it deepened, and deepened,
until she tingled from head to foot, and a mist
obscured her vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in all this world would give me
more pleasure,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>The girl turned and fled.</p>
<p>That very evening Dr. Carter availed himself
of the invitation. Singularly enough, since she
had been hoping all the afternoon that he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
come, Clementine Willis was frightened when
his name was announced. Her hand was shaking
when he took it in his; but there was not a
trace of expression on his face.</p>
<p>Miss Willis realized, for the first time, that
she had been horribly brazen&ndash;&ndash;or, at least, she
told herself that she had been&ndash;&ndash;and as a consequence,
she was wretchedly ill at ease. Her
distress was in marked contrast with the man&#8217;s
self-possession, which amounted almost to indifference.
There was no spark visible of the
fire which had flashed earlier in the day. It was
as though he had steeled himself to remain invulnerable
throughout the call.</p>
<p>And the usually composed girl prattled aimlessly,
voicing platitudes, conventionalities, banalities,
inanities&ndash;&ndash;anything to gain time and
to cover her embarrassment: to all of which the
man listened in sober silence, watching her
steadily.</p>
<p>Abruptly, Miss Willis grew angry with
herself, and stopped. When angry she was
collected.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter&#8217;s face lit up humorously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have no idea,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how you have
relieved my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I supposed I was the embarrassed individual,&#8221;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had only given me a hint,&#8221; suggested
the girl, reproachfully. She was now amazed
that she had ever lost her grip upon herself, and
wondered why she had.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hint!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I was dumb; I
thought you&#8217;d see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tension was off, and they laughed together.
From then on, both remained natural.
In the midst of a lull, Dr. Carter suddenly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think me a barbarian, Miss Willis,
but I have a request to make. I am in the mood
to-night to be unconventional&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the corners of
his serious mouth lifted humorously&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;to be
what I really am,&#8221; he illuminated, &#8220;and to meet
you in the same spirit.&#8221; He paused with a little
shrug. &#8220;It is a disappointing reversion to the
primitive, I must admit.&#8221; He glanced up
whimsically. &#8220;May I ask you a question&ndash;&ndash;any
question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it possible,&#8221; the girl evaded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
&#8220;for a modern woman to meet you&ndash;&ndash;the way
you say&ndash;&ndash;naturally?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed to question her seriousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen little of women for a number of
years,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;but I&#8217;d hate to think it
impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little of women!&#8221; was the surprised
comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You misunderstand,&#8221; he quickly corrected.
&#8220;I go out so seldom that the woman I see is not
the real woman at all; not the woman of home.&#8221;
His hand made a little motion of forbearance.
&#8220;In his consultation-room the patients of a
physician are&ndash;&ndash;sexless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that a woman&ndash;&ndash;that I&ndash;&ndash;can still
be natural, Dr. Carter,&#8221; said Miss Willis,
slowly, her eyes downcast. &#8220;What did you
wish to ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his turn to hesitate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know how to put it, now that I
have permission,&#8221; he apologized, with a deprecatory
little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seldom do things in this world,&#8221; he
went on at once, &#8220;unless we want to, or unless
the alternative of not doing them is more unpleasant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
He merged generalities into a more
specific assertion. &#8220;There was no alternative
in your requesting me to call. Candidly, why
do I interest you?&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was alive, and the woman, now
thoroughly mistress of herself, gazed into the
frankest of frank gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely know,&#8221; she said, weighing her
answer. &#8220;Perhaps it was the novel experience
of being considered&ndash;&ndash;sexless; of being classified
by a number, like a beetle in a case. Let
me answer with another question: Why did I
interest you sufficiently to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat in the big chair with his chin in his
hand, looking now steadily past and beyond her,
one foot restlessly tapping the rug.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer without it seeming so hopelessly
egotistical.&#8221; The half-whimsical, half-serious
smile returned to his eyes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
me impose upon your leniency, please; I may
wish to make a request sometime again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will accept the responsibility,&#8221; she
insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;On your head, then, the consequences.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
spoke lightly, but with a note of restlessness
and rebellion.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me you are attractive, Miss Willis, because
you are everything that I am not. With
you there is no necessity higher than the present;
no responsibility beyond the chance
thought of the moment. You choose your
surroundings, your thoughts. Your life is
what you make it: it is life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly would not charge me with
being more independent than you?&#8221; protested
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Independent!&#8221; he flashed upon her, and she
knew she had stirred something lying close to
his soul. His voice grew soft, and he repeated
the word, musingly, more to himself than to
her: &#8220;Independent!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; with abrupt feeling, &#8220;with the sort
of independence that chooses its own manner of
absolute dependence; with the independence
that gives you only so much of my time, so that
the remainder may go to another; with the independence
of imperative impartiality; the sort
of independence that is never through working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
and planning for others&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the independence
I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are breathing-spells,&#8221; interrupted
Miss Willis, smilingly. &#8220;To-night, for
example, you are not working for somebody
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You compel me to incriminate myself,&#8221; he
rejoined, the whimsical, half-serious smile again
lighting his gray eyes. &#8220;I should be working
now, and I will have to make up the lost time
when I go home.&#8221; He bowed gallantly. &#8220;The
pleasure is double with me, you observe; I do
not think twice about paying a double price for
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke lightly, almost mockingly; but beneath
the surface there was even the bitter ring
of revolt, and constantly before the girl were the
little gestures, intense, impatient, that conveyed
a meaning he did not voice. She could feel in
it all the insistent atmosphere of the town,
where time is counted by seconds. She wondered
that he felt as he did, ignorant that the
disquiet had come into his life only during the
past week. To her, the glimpse of activity was
fascinating simply because it was in sharp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
contrast with her life of comparative, dull
emptiness.</p>
<p>He caught the wistful look on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder that I rebel,&#8221; he said, with an
odd little throaty laugh. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t well appear
any more unsophisticated: I might as well
tell you. It&#8217;s not the work itself, but the lack
of anything else but work that makes the lives
of such as I so bare. We are constantly holding
a stop-watch on time itself, fearful of losing a
second; the scratch of a pen sealing the life of
a Nation, commuting a death-sentence, defining
the difference between a man&#8217;s success and ruin
can all be accomplished in a second. If we let
that second get away from us, we have been
deaf to Opportunity&#8217;s knock. We stop at times
to think; and then the object for which we give
our all appears so petty and inadequate, and
what we are losing, so great. We laugh at our
work at such times, and for the moment hate
it.&#8221; But he laughed lightly, and finished with
a deprecating little minor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;m relaxing to-night&ndash;&ndash;and
thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Miss Willis protested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
why you should have only the one thing in your
life. It is certainly unnecessary, unless you
choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no conception of what it means
to shape your life to your income. I am poor,
and I know. Years ago I had to choose between
mediocrity and&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he looked at her peculiarly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and
love, or advancement alone. I had to
choose, and fixing my choice upon the higher
aim, I had to put everything else out of my life.
The thought is intolerable that my name should
always be under another&#8217;s upon some office-door.
You know what I chose: you know nothing
of the constant struggle which alone keeps
me, mind, soul, and body, centred upon my
ideal, nor how readily I respond to a temptation
to turn aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he completed listlessly, &#8220;is one of
the nights when the price seems too large; in
spite of me, regret will creep in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; persisted the girl, &#8220;when you succeed&ndash;&ndash;it
will not be&ndash;&ndash;too late?&#8221; There was a
plaintive inquiry in the words; the tragedy of
the man&#8217;s life had awakened pity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span></p>
<p>He spoke with a sudden passion that startled
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late already; my work has refashioned
my life. I am desperately restless except
when doing something that counts; something
visible; and doing it intensely. I&#8217;ll never&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his
voice was bitter with regret&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;never conform&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl answered, almost unconsciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you can,&#8221; she hesitated, &#8220;and will.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long, long moment they searched each
other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this price you are paying,&#8221; said the
girl at last, &#8220;is it worth it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I wonder! To-night doubt has undermined
my resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you question yourself so seriously,&#8221; she
said very softly, &#8220;then surely you can find but
one answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again I wonder. I have wondered and&ndash;&ndash;and
hoped&ndash;&ndash;God help me!&ndash;&ndash;since the moment
I looked into your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly he was out of his chair and coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
toward her. Her heart leaped, her eyes shone;
she extended her hands in welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will come again,&#8221; she whispered,
as they drew together.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will let me. I couldn&#8217;t stay away
now.&#8221;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em'>THE END</p>
